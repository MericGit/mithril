    <ns0:title>Design, Implementation and Control of an Underactuated Hand Exoskeleton</ns0:title>
    <ns0:summary>  I present the design, implementation and control of a novel, linkage-based,
underactuated hand exoskeleton aimed to assist patients with hand disabilities
during grasping tasks for robot assisted physical rehabilitation or robot
assisted activities of daily living. Even though the proposed exoskeleton was
designed with the purpose of assisting users during interactions with real
objects around them, its use can be extended for haptic applications as well.
In this thesis, I will deeply mention the exoskeletons in the literature,
detail the design decisions and implement various control strategies to use
this exoskeleton for different applications in the future.
