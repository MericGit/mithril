    <ns0:title>Autonomous Building Cyber-Physical Systems Using Decentralized
  Autonomous Organizations, Digital Twins, and Large Language Model</ns0:title>
    <ns0:summary>  Current autonomous building research primarily focuses on energy efficiency
and automation. While traditional artificial intelligence has advanced
autonomous building research, it often relies on predefined rules and struggles
to adapt to complex, evolving building operations. Moreover, the centralized
organizational structures of facilities management hinder transparency in
decision-making, limiting true building autonomy. Research on decentralized
governance and adaptive building infrastructure, which could overcome these
challenges, remains relatively unexplored. This paper addresses these
limitations by introducing a novel Decentralized Autonomous Building
Cyber-Physical System framework that integrates Decentralized Autonomous
Organizations, Large Language Models, and digital twins to create a smart,
self-managed, operational, and financially autonomous building infrastructure.
This study develops a full-stack decentralized application to facilitate
decentralized governance of building infrastructure. An LLM-based artificial
intelligence assistant is developed to provide intuitive human-building
interaction for blockchain and building operation management-related tasks and
enable autonomous building operation. Six real-world scenarios were tested to
evaluate the autonomous building system's workability, including building
revenue and expense management, AI-assisted facility control, and autonomous
adjustment of building systems. Results indicate that the prototype
successfully executes these operations, confirming the framework's suitability
for developing building infrastructure with decentralized governance and
autonomous operation.
