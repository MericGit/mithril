    <ns0:title>Jamming Attacks and Anti-Jamming Strategies in Wireless Networks: A
  Comprehensive Survey</ns0:title>
    <ns0:summary>  Wireless networks are a key component of the telecommunications
infrastructure in our society, and wireless services become increasingly
important as the applications of wireless devices have penetrated every aspect
of our lives. Although wireless technologies have significantly advanced in the
past decades, most wireless networks are still vulnerable to radio jamming
attacks due to the openness nature of wireless channels, and the progress in
the design of jamming-resistant wireless networking systems remains limited.
This stagnation can be attributed to the lack of practical physical-layer
wireless technologies that can efficiently decode data packets in the presence
of jamming attacks. This article surveys existing jamming attacks and
anti-jamming strategies in wireless local area networks (WLANs), cellular
networks, cognitive radio networks (CRNs), ZigBee networks, Bluetooth networks,
vehicular networks, LoRa networks, RFID networks, and GPS system, with the
objective of offering a comprehensive knowledge landscape of existing
jamming/anti-jamming strategies and stimulating more research efforts to secure
wireless networks against jamming attacks. Different from prior survey papers,
this article conducts a comprehensive, in-depth review on jamming and
anti-jamming strategies, casting insights on the design of jamming-resilient
wireless networking systems. An outlook on promising antijamming techniques is
offered at the end of this article to delineate important research directions.
