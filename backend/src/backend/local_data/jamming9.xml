    <ns0:title>Jamming-Aware Control Plane in Elastic Optical Networks</ns0:title>
    <ns0:summary>  Physical layer security is essential in optical networks. In this paper, we
study a jamming-aware control plane, in which a high power jamming attack
exists in the network. The studied control plane considers that the jammed
connections can be detected and avoided. We used a physical layer model, in
which we embedded the additional jamming power, to evaluate different security
in scenarios, such as a jamming-free scenario, jamming with an unaware
controller, and jamming with an aware controller. The performance is analyzed
in terms of the blocking rate and slots utilization. We analyze the impact of
jamming attacks in the least used link and in the most used link on the
network. The results demonstrates that the jamming avoidance by the control
plane can reach performance near the not jammed scenario.
