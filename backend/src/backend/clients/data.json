Logical anomalies may appear visually normal yet violate predefined constraints on object presence, arrangement, or quantity, depending on reasoning and explainability. We introduce LogicQA, a framework that enhances AD by providing industrial operators with explanations for logical anomalies. LogicQA compiles automatically generated questions into a check-list and collects responses to identify violations of logical constraints. LogicQA is training-free, annotation-free, and operates in a few-shot setting. We achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) Logical AD performance on the public benchmark, MVTec LOCO AD, with an AUROC of 87.6% and an F\u2081-max of 87.0% along with the explanations of anomalies. Also, our approach has shown outstanding performance on semiconductor SEM corporate data, further validating its effectiveness in industrial applications.",

The system utilizes a new Neural Network architecture developed from existing research, incorporating innovative state and action representations tailored to these specific game environments. With minimal training, our solution has shown promising results in typical scenarios, demonstrating the ability to generalize across different terrain and tactical situations.

Machine learning techniques including deep reinforcement learning (DRL) have been identified as promising approaches, but require high-fidelity training environments and feature extractors to generate information for the agent. This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning training approach, utilising the Stone Soup tracking framework as a feature extractor to train an agent for a sensor management task. A general framework for embedding Stone Soup tracker components within a Gymnasium environment is presented, enabling fast and configurable tracker deployments for RL training using Stable Baselines3. The approach is demonstrated in a sensor management task where an agent is trained to search and track a region of airspace utilising track lists generated from Stone Soup trackers. A sample implementation using three neural network architectures in a search-and-track scenario demonstrates the approach and shows that RL agents can outperform simple sensor search and track policies when trained within the Gymnasium and Stone Soup environment.",

By fully exploiting the multi-threading power of GPU and CPU, current state-of-the-art tools can achieve real-time ocean simulation, even if it is sometimes needed to reduce the physical realism for large scenes. Although most of the building blocks for implementing an ocean simulator are described in the literature, a clear explanation of how they interconnect is lacking. Hence, this paper proposes to bring all these components together, detailing all their interactions, in a comprehensive and fully described real-time framework that simulates the free ocean surface and the coupling between solids and fluid. This article also presents several improvements to enhance the physical realism of our model. The two main ones are: calculating the real-time velocity of ocean fluids at any depth; computing the input of the fluid to solid coupling algorithm.",

The framework's ability to simulate ocean surfaces and fluid-solid interactions in real-time suggests potential applications in areas such as naval operations, submarine design, and underwater robotics, particularly for the U.S. military. Lilian Aveneau's military service and research in radio and optical simulation, along with the paper's focus on real-time performance and fluid dynamics, further indicates military relevance. The research is conducted in France, which introduces a risk related to foreign military development and the potential for technology transfer to adversaries. Berenger Bramas's work in High-Performance Computing (HPC) and parallel computing could contribute to military applications, given the importance of computational resources in modern warfare, and he is also a foreign national. The other authors do not appear to have any military involvement. The paper's topics, including High-Performance Computing, are also relevant to military applications.",

        "abstract": "Rapid advances in AI are beginning to reshape national security. Destabilizing AI developments could rupture the balance of power and raise the odds of great-power conflict, while widespread proliferation of capable AI hackers and virologists would lower barriers for rogue actors to cause catastrophe. Superintelligence\u2014AI vastly better than humans at nearly all cognitive tasks\u2014is now anticipated by AI researchers. Just as nations once developed nuclear strategies to secure their survival, we now need a coherent superintelligence strategy to navigate a new period of transformative change. We introduce the concept of Mutual Assured AI Malfunction (MAIM): a deterrence regime resembling nuclear mutual assured destruction (MAD) where any state\u2019s aggressive bid for unilateral AI dominance is met with preventive sabotage by rivals. Given the relative ease of sabotaging a destabilizing AI project through interventions ranging from covert cyberattacks to potential kinetic strikes on datacenters\u2014MAIM already describes the strategic picture AI superpowers find themselves in. Alongside this, states can increase their competitiveness by bolstering their economies and militaries through AI, and they can engage in nonproliferation to rogue actors to keep weaponizable AI capabilities out of their hands. Taken together, the three-part framework of deterrence, nonproliferation, and competitiveness outlines a robust strategy to superintelligence in the years ahead.",

This approach combines information in the time and frequency domains with a U-Net-LSTM deep learning model, significantly improving the restoration quality of dynamic target images at high frame rates. The experimental results demonstrate that dynamic target imaging with an average photon number of less than 10 per pixel can be achieved using 16-channel parallel detection, where the pixel size is 256 \u00d7 256 and the frame rate is 200 fps.. Compared to conventional Block Compressed Sensing Imaging, this method increases the peak signal-to-noise ratio to 38.66 dB and improves the structural similarity index to 0.96. In the presence of a dynamic scattering medium and a static complex background, we successfully achieved imaging and tracking of two targets undergoing complex motion. Even in scenarios where the targets overlap or obstruct each other, we can still reconstruct clear images of each individual target separately.. This method provides an effective solution for large-pixel dynamic target recognition, tracking, and real-time imaging in complex environments, offering promising applications in remote sensing, military reconnaissance, and beyond.",

        "abstract": "Wireless signal recognition (WSR) is a crucial technique for intelligent communications and spectrum sharing in the next six-generation (6G) wireless communication networks. It can be utilized to enhance network performance and efficiency, improve quality of service (QoS), and improve network security and reliability. Additionally, WSR can be applied for military applications such as signal interception, signal race, and signal abduction. In the past decades, great efforts have been made for the research of WSR. Earlier works mainly focus on model-based methods, including likelihood-based (LB) and feature-based (FB) methods, which have taken the leading position for many years. With the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI), intelligent methods including machine learning-based (ML-based) and deep learning-based (DL-based) methods have been developed to extract the features of the received signals and perform the classification. In this work, we provide a comprehensive review of WSR from the view of applications, main tasks, recent advances, datasets and evaluation metrics, challenges, and future directions. Specifically, intelligent WSR methods are introduced from the perspective of model, data, learning and implementation. Moreover, we analyze the challenges for WSR from the view of complex, dynamic, and open 6G wireless environments and discuss the future directions for WSR. This survey is expected to provide a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art WSR techniques and inspire new research directions for WSR in 6G networks.",

        "abstract": "In a globalized and interconnected world, interoperability has become a key concept for advancing tactical scenarios. Federated Coalition Networks (FCN) enable cooperation between entities from multiple nations while allowing each to maintain control over their systems. However, this interoperability necessitates the sharing of increasing amounts of information between different tactical assets, raising the need for higher security measures. Emerging technologies like blockchain drive a revolution in secure communications, paving the way for new tactical scenarios. In this work, we propose a blockchain-based framework to enhance the resilience and security of the management of these networks. We offer a guide to FCN design to help a broad audience understand the military networks in international missions by a use case and key functions applied to a proposed architecture. We evaluate its effectiveness and performance in information encryption to validate this framework.",

        "abstract": "With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, intelligent decision-making techniques have gradually surpassed human levels in various human-machine competitions, especially in complex multi-agent cooperative task scenarios. Multi-agent cooperative decision-making involves multiple agents working together to complete established tasks and achieve specific objectives. These techniques are widely applicable in real-world scenarios such as autonomous driving, drone navigation, disaster rescue, and simulated military confrontations. This paper begins with a comprehensive survey of the leading simulation environments and platforms used for multi-agent cooperative decision-making. Specifically, we provide an in-depth analysis for these simulation environments from various perspectives, including task formats, reward allocation, and the underlying technologies employed. Subsequently, we provide a comprehensive overview of the mainstream intelligent decision-making approaches, algorithms and models for multi-agent systems (MAS). These approaches can be broadly categorized into five types: rule-based (primarily fuzzy logic), game theory-based, evolutionary algorithms-based, deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)-based, and large language models (LLMs) reasoning-based. Given the significant advantages of MARL and LLMs-based decision-making methods over the traditional rule, game theory, and evolutionary algorithms, this paper focuses on these multi-agent methods utilizing MARL and LLMs-based techniques. We provide an in-depth discussion of these approaches, highlighting their methodology taxonomies, advantages, and drawbacks. Further, several prominent research directions in the future and potential challenges of multi-agent cooperative decision-making are also detailed.",

        "abstract": "Collaborative underwater target hunting, facilitated by multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), plays a significant role in various domains, especially military missions. Existing research predominantly focuses on designing efficient and high-success-rate hunting policy, particularly addressing the target's evasion capabilities. However, in real-world scenarios, the target can not only adjust its evasion policy based on its observations and predictions but also possess eavesdropping capabilities. If communication among hunter AUVs, such as hunting policy exchanges, is intercepted by the target, it can adapt its escape policy accordingly, significantly reducing the success rate of the hunting mission. To address this challenge, we propose a covert communication-guaranteed collaborative target hunting framework, which ensures efficient hunting in complex underwater environments while defending against the target's eavesdropping. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to incorporate the confidentiality of inter-agent communication into the design of target hunting policy. Furthermore, given the complexity of coordinating multiple AUVs in dynamic and unpredictable environments, we propose an adaptive multi-agent diffusion policy (AMADP), which incorporates the strong generative ability of diffusion models into the multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that AMADP achieves faster convergence and higher hunting success rates while maintaining covertness constraints.",

Accurate modulation identification and parameter estimation enable effective signal classification, threat assessment, and the development of countermeasures. In this paper, we propose a symbolic approach for radar signal recognition and parameter estimation based on a vision-language model that combines context-free grammar with time-frequency representation of radar waveforms. The proposed model, called Sig2text, leverages the power of vision transformers for time-frequency feature extraction and transformer-based decoders for symbolic parsing of radar waveforms. By treating radar signal recognition as a parsing problem, Sig2text can effectively recognize and parse radar waveforms with different modulation types and parameters. We evaluate the performance of Sig2text on a synthetic radar signal dataset and demonstrate its effectiveness in recognizing and parsing radar waveforms with varying modulation types and parameters.

In this paper, we present a game-theoretic approach for selecting effective combinations of security controls based on expected attacker profiles and a set budget. The control selection problem is set up as a two-person zero-sum one-shot game. Valid control combinations for selection are generated using an algebraic formalism to account for dependencies among selected controls. Using a software tool, we apply the approach on a fictional Canadian military system with Canada's standardized control catalogue, ITSG-33. Through this case study, we demonstrate the approach's scalability to assist in selecting an effective set of security controls for large systems. The results illustrate how a security analyst can use the proposed approach and supporting tool to guide and support decision-making in the control selection activity when developing secure systems of all sizes.",

        "abstract": "Sarcasm detection, as a crucial research direction in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), has attracted widespread attention. Traditional sarcasm detection tasks have typically focused on single-modal approaches (e.g., text), but due to the implicit and subtle nature of sarcasm, such methods often fail to yield satisfactory results. In recent years, researchers have shifted the focus of sarcasm detection to multi-modal approaches. However, effectively leveraging multi-modal information to accurately identify sarcastic content remains a challenge that warrants further exploration. Leveraging the powerful integrated processing capabilities of Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for various information sources, we propose an innovative multi-modal Commander-GPT framework. Inspired by military strategy, we first decompose the sarcasm detection task into six distinct sub-tasks. A central commander (decision-maker) then assigns the best-suited large language model to address each specific sub-task. Ultimately, the detection results from each model are aggregated to identify sarcasm. We conducted extensive experiments on MMSD and MMSD 2.0, utilizing four multi-modal large language models and six prompting strategies. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 19.3% improvement in F1 score, without necessitating fine-tuning or ground-truth rationales.",

The framework's architecture, inspired by military strategy (commander, civil officials, military officers), is inherently interesting. While the primary application is in NLP for sentiment analysis, the core technology could be adapted for military purposes. Specifically, the ability to accurately detect sarcasm could be useful in analyzing communications, social media, or other text-based sources for propaganda, disinformation, or hostile intent. Given the paper's publication in China, it's essential to consider the potential for its use in a strategic context. The involvement of researchers from multiple institutions, with potential connections to military research, raises further concerns. While the direct application of the technology to military use is not explicitly stated, the underlying principles and techniques could be adapted. Furthermore, given the location of the research (China), this poses a higher risk from a US perspective due to potential geopolitical implications and the possibility of it being leveraged against US interests, and is thus scored high.",

        "abstract": "Silicon-based integrated photonics has demonstrated significant advances in miniaturization and performance, yet critical challenges remain in achieving efficient on-chip communication at high bandwidths. Plasmonic devices on silicon and silicon-on-insulator substrates offer a promising solution, enabling subwavelength light confinement and enhanced light-matter interactions through hybrid modes. However, integrating traditional plasmonic materials like gold and silver into silicon-based platforms presents significant challenges, particularly due to their incompatibility with standard silicon processing techniques and their increased optical losses at longer wavelengths, which can hinder performance in near-infrared applications. Plasmonic devices, leveraging advances in device architectures, have the potential to close these performance gaps and enable the next generation of high-speed, on-chip data communication. This review explores recent progress in silicon-integrated hybrid-mode plasmonic devices, highlighting the potential of transparent conductive oxides like indium tin oxide for low-loss and tunable operation. Key device topologies including coupled hybrid plasmonic waveguides and dielectric-based heterostructures are examined, along with fabrication techniques and practical considerations. By critically comparing various plasmonic approaches and identifying their respective advantages and limitations, a path toward realizing the full potential of plasmonics in shaping the future of high-performance, silicon-based integrated photonics is charted.",

We first formulate the diffusive relaxation system based on the even-odd decomposition method, which allows us to split into one relaxation step and one transport step. We adopt a robust implicit scheme that can be explicitly implemented for the relaxation step that involves the stiffness of the collision term, while the third-order strong-stability-preserving Runge-Kutta method is employed for the transport step. We couple this temporal scheme with the DG method for spatial discretization, which provides additional advantages including high-order accuracy, h-p adaptivity, and the ability to handle arbitrary unstructured meshes. A positivity-preserving limiter is further applied to preserve physical properties of numerical solutions. The stability analysis using the even-odd decomposition is conducted for the first time. We demonstrate the accuracy and performance of our proposed scheme through several numerical examples.",

The analysis integrates radar-derived spatiotemporal precipitation patterns with hydrological sensor data to improve flood prediction capabilities. A key innovation is the use of residual-based modeling to address the non-linearity between precipitation and water levels, leading to a Spatiotemporal Radar-based Precipitation Model with residuals (STRPMr). Unlike traditional hydrological models, this approach doesn't rely on upstream data and uses a deep learning architecture integrating (2+1)D convolutional neural networks and LSTM for timeseries forecasting. The results demonstrate the potential of STRPMr for capturing extreme events and more accurate flood forecasting.",

        "abstract": "Shell DFT-1/2 is a fast band gap rectification method that is versatile for semiconductor supercell and superlattice calculations, which involves two cutoff radii that have to be optimized. Although such optimization is trivial in terms of time cost for a primitive cell, in high-throughput calculations this can be a big concern because most materials are themselves in small unit cells. The numerous optimization trials increase the computational cost to orders of magnitudes higher. In this work, we construct a regression model for the prediction of the two cutoff radii based on chemical composition and primitive cell structure. Moreover, a model for metal and insulator classification is also given, with 95.2% accuracy.",

So far, however, such a method has not been established yet. Here we show a novel method for doping hole into n-type topological insulators Bi2X3 (X = Se, Te) that overcomes the shortcomings of the previous reported methods. The key of this doping is to adsorb H2O on Bi2X3 decorated with a small amount of carbon, and its trigger is the irradiation of photon with sufficient energy to excite core-electrons of the outermost layer atoms. This method allows controlling the doping amount by the irradiation time, and acts as photolithography. Such a tunable doping makes it possible to design the electronic states at the nanometer scale, and thus paves a promising avenue toward the realization of novel spintronics devices based on topological insulators.",

Here we demonstrate that van der Waals materials, such as the 2D semiconductor MoSe2, can easily be transferred onto gold plasmonic nanowaveguides using standard dry visco-elastic polymer transfer techniques. We further show that the photoluminescence from MoSe2 can be injected directly into these on-chip waveguides. Our fabrication methods are compatible with large-scale roll-to-roll manufacturing techniques, highlighting a potential cost-effective and scalable hybrid plasmonic and 2D semiconductor platform for integrated nanophotonics.",

The authors highlight the potential of this approach for cost-effective and scalable hybrid plasmonic and 2D semiconductor platforms, particularly for future photonic integrated circuits. The paper emphasizes the mutual compatibility between plasmonic waveguide systems and 2D semiconductors, opening up new avenues for PIC systems based on 2D material light-sources.",

        "abstract": "Semiconductor devices, especially MOSFETs (Metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor), are crucial in power electronics, but their reliability is affected by aging processes influenced by cycling and temperature. The primary aging mechanism in discrete semiconductors and power modules is the bond wire lift-off, caused by crack growth due to thermal fatigue. The process is empirically characterized by exponential growth and an abrupt end of life, making long-term aging forecasts challenging. This research presents a comprehensive comparative assessment of different forecasting methods for MOSFET failure forecasting applications. Classical tracking, statistical forecasting and Neural Network (NN) based forecasting models are implemented along with novel Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFTs). A comprehensive comparison is performed assessing their MOSFET ageing forecasting ability for different forecasting horizons. For short-term predictions, all algorithms result in acceptable results, with the best results produced by classical NN forecasting models at the expense of higher computations. For long-term forecasting, only the TFT is able to produce valid outcomes owing to the ability to integrate covariates from the expected future conditions. Additionally, TFT attention points identify key ageing turning points, which indicate new failure modes or accelerated ageing phases.",

The presence of Jose I. Aizpurua, who has published a paper related to military simulation and artificial intelligence, adds further potential for military application of the techniques discussed. The country of origin, Spain, is not a primary military threat but the application of these techniques could be seen as a possible dual-use technology that could be used by foreign military powers.

        "abstract": "1998 KY26 is a tiny near-Earth asteroid (H = 26.1) discovered in 1998. It has been selected as the target of the Hayabusa2 extended mission, which will rendezvous with 1998 KY26 in 2031. However, one of the most basic physical properties, size, remains poorly constrained, posing potential challenges for spacecraft operations. We aimed at constraining the size of 1998 KY26 by means of thermal infrared observations. We performed thermal infrared observations of 1998 KY26 using the ESO Very Large Telescope/VISIR on three consecutive nights in May 2024. After stacking all frames, we find no apparent detection of 1998 KY26 on the resulting images. The upper-limit flux density of 1998 KY26 is derived as 2 mJy at 10.64 \u03bcm. From this upper-limit flux density obtained via non-detection, we conclude that the diameter of 1998 KY26 is smaller than 17 m with thermophysical modeling. This upper limit size is smaller than the radar-derived 30 (\u00b110) m. Our size constraint on 1998 KY26 is essential for the operation of the Hayabusa2 spacecraft during proximity operations using remote sensing instruments as well as a possible impact experiment using the remaining projectile.",

        "abstract": "The most important security benefit of software memory safety is easy to state: for C and C++ software, attackers can exploit most bugs and vulnerabilities to gain full, unfettered control of software behavior, whereas this is not true for most bugs in memory-safe software-just a few [26]. Fortunately, this security benefit-most bugs don't give attackers full control-can be had for unmodified C and C++ software, without per-application effort. This doesn't require trying to establish memory safety; instead, it is sufficient to eliminate most of the combinatorial ways in which software with corrupted memory can execute. There already exist practical compiler and runtime mechanisms to eliminate these avenues for attack; these mechanisms incur little overhead and need no special hardware or platform support. Each of the mechanisms described here is already in production use, at scale, on one or more platforms. By supporting their combined use in development toolchains, the security of all C and C++ software against remote code execution attacks can be rapidly, and dramatically, improved.",

        "title": "Extending Silicon Lifetime: A Review of Design Techniques for Reliable Integrated Circuits",
        "abstract": "Reliability has become an increasing concern in modern computing. Integrated circuits (ICs) are the backbone of today's computing devices across industries, including artificial intelligence (AI), consumer electronics, healthcare, automotive, industrial, and aerospace. Moore's Law has driven the semiconductor IC industry toward smaller dimensions, improved performance, and greater energy efficiency. However, as transistors shrink to atomic scales, aging-related degradation mechanisms such as Bias Temperature Instability (BTI), Hot Carrier Injection (HCI), Time-Dependent Dielectric Breakdown (TDDB), Electromigration (EM), and stochastic aging-induced variations have become major reliability threats. From an application perspective, applications like AI training and autonomous driving require continuous and sustainable operation to minimize recovery costs and enhance safety. Additionally, the high cost of chip replacement and reproduction underscores the need for extended lifespans. These factors highlight the urgency of designing more reliable ICs as key computing infrastructure. This survey addresses the critical issue of aging in ICs, focusing on fundamental degradation mechanisms and mitigation strategies. It provides a comprehensive overview of aging's impact and the methods to counter it, starting with the root causes of aging and summarizing key monitoring techniques at both circuit and system levels. A detailed analysis of circuit-level mitigation strategies highlights the distinct aging characteristics of digital, analog, and SRAM circuits, emphasizing the need for tailored solutions. The survey also explores emerging software approaches in design automation, aging characterization, and mitigation, which are transforming traditional reliability optimization. Finally, it outlines the challenges and future directions for improving aging management and ensuring the long-term reliability of ICs across diverse applications.",

        "abstract": "The inability of autonomous vehicles (AVs) to infer the material properties of obstacles limits their decision-making capacity. While AVs rely on sensor systems such as cameras, LiDAR, and radar to detect obstacles, this study suggests combining sensors with a knowledge graph (KG)-based world model to improve AVs' comprehension of physical material qualities. Beyond sensor data, AVs can infer qualities such as malleability, density, and elasticity using a semantic KG that depicts the relationships between obstacles and their attributes. Using the CARLA autonomous driving simulator, we evaluated AV performance with and without KG integration. The findings demonstrate that the KG-based method improves obstacle management, which allows AVs to use material qualities to make better decisions about when to change lanes or apply emergency braking. For example, the KG-integrated AV changed lanes for hard impediments like traffic cones and successfully avoided collisions with flexible items such as plastic bags by passing over them. Compared to the control system, the KG framework demonstrated improved responsiveness to obstacles by resolving conflicting sensor data, causing emergency stops for 13.3% more cases. In addition, our method exhibits a 6.6% higher success rate in lane-changing maneuvers in experimental scenarios, particularly for larger, high-impact obstacles. While we focus particularly on autonomous driving, our work demonstrates the potential of KG-based world models to improve decision-making in embodied AI systems and scale to other domains, including robotics, healthcare, and environmental simulation.",

This has clear military applications. The core technology, improving AV decision-making based on material properties, is directly applicable to military vehicles, such as tanks, unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), and autonomous reconnaissance platforms. The ability to differentiate between obstacles (e.g., knowing whether a barrier is easily penetrable or a solid wall) allows for enhanced tactical maneuvering, route planning, and target engagement. The use of KGs to model the world and inform AV decisions is relevant to military contexts. The authors are based in the USA. Given the USA based perspective, and this research potentially being leveraged by military branches, the risk is moderate, but the risk would increase with the presence of foreign entities or collaborators. Considering the potential military utility and the lack of specific details about author affiliations with military projects or projects, and given the lack of foreign military development, a moderate risk score is appropriate. Therefore, the risk is low as this technology is still in early development stages.",

        "abstract": "The widespread adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has introduced significant cybersecurity challenges, particularly with the increasing frequency and sophistication of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Traditional machine learning (ML) techniques often fall short in detecting such attacks due to the complexity of blended and evolving patterns. To address this, we propose a novel framework leveraging On-Device Large Language Models (ODLLMs) augmented with fine-tuning and knowledge base (KB) integration for intelligent IoT network attack detection. By implementing feature ranking techniques and constructing both long and short KBs tailored to model capacities, the proposed framework ensures efficient and accurate detection of DDoS attacks while overcoming computational and privacy limitations. Simulation results demonstrate that the optimized framework achieves superior accuracy across diverse attack types, especially when using compact models in edge computing environments. This work provides a scalable and secure solution for real-time IoT security, advancing the applicability of edge intelligence in cybersecurity.",

Specifically, this paper explores the consequences of assuming that the family of spatial receptive fields should be covariant under spatial affine transformations, thereby implying that the receptive fields ought to span a variability over the degree of elongation. We investigate the theoretical properties of three main ways of defining idealized models of complex cells and compare the predictions from these models to neurophysiologically obtained receptive field histograms over the resultant of biological orientation selectivity curves. It is shown that the extended modelling mechanisms lead to more uniform behaviour and a wider span over the values of the resultants that are covered, compared to earlier presented idealized models of complex cells without spatial integration. More generally, we propose that the presented methodology could be used as a new tool to evaluate other computational models of complex cells in relation to biological measurements.",

While the core research areas (astrophysics, high-performance computing) don't directly translate to immediate military applications, the data science and simulation methodologies could be relevant for modeling complex environments and phenomena. However, the primary focus on space-based observations and theoretical astrophysics limits direct military utility. Furthermore, the presence of authors from Brazil and affiliations with Pakistani institutions and universities adds a layer of risk from a US perspective, due to potential foreign military development implications, though indirect in this case. The paper's topics, such as advanced materials (potentially relevant for shielding), and the use of high-performance computing, have indirect but present utility.\n\nThe paper does not describe any materials or research that would immediately violate any known United States arms export regulations.",

The study employs 3D magnetohydrodynamical simulations to model the turbulent intergalactic medium and explores the interaction of cosmic rays with this environment, calculating the associated fluxes of cosmic rays and neutrinos using Monte Carlo simulations. The paper investigates how cosmic ray spectra depend on injection position, the confinement of cosmic rays due to magnetic fields, and the production of secondary particles, particularly neutrinos and gamma rays. It finds that cosmic rays with energy below a certain threshold cannot escape the cluster's innermost regions and explores potential applications to understand high energy emission by galaxy clusters.",

Currently, over 92% of global anode material is produced in China, posing a geopolitical risk for other countries reliant on graphite supply for domestic industries. This paper assesses the costs of producing battery-grade graphite (natural and synthetic) in the US and China using process-based cost models. We find that production costs in the US significantly exceed those in China due to higher capital intensity and input costs. Our analysis reveals that a majority of modeled projects in the US are not competitive at current market prices. We identify key cost drivers, including capital costs, economies of scale, and input material prices, and explore pathways to improve the competitiveness of US graphite production, such as supportive financing and process innovation directions. The analysis of conventional graphite production costs at scale also informs ceiling costs for alternative, promising pathways such as methane pyrolysis and catalytic graphitization. This study highlights the challenges and trade-offs in building a diversified graphite supply chain and informs policy and investment decisions.",

The paper analyzes the cost competitiveness of US graphite production compared to China's, identifying challenges and potential solutions like supportive financing and process innovation. While the core technology (graphite production) has clear applications in electric vehicles and energy storage, the US military relies heavily on both. Therefore any weakness in this supply chain would also be a weakness for the military. Additionally, the focus on supply chain security and reducing reliance on China directly aligns with US national security interests. The research's findings could inform strategies to reduce dependence on potentially adversarial nations. However, this research on graphite production is not directly weaponizable, and it is fundamental research. The biggest military risk factor would be if China's dominance of graphite supply chains would continue, so developing this area of research would be vital for US military production. There are no specific military details in the paper and the authors have no known military connections. The focus of the paper is general material science and not specific to military applications. Therefore, the overall risk score is relatively low. The greatest benefit would be in securing a supply chain for the military.",

The topics covered, such as autonomous systems, cybersecurity, and defense technology, are all critical areas for military advancement. The paper's analysis of AI development in the U.S., China, and Russia further suggests an emphasis on strategic advantage. Given the U.S. perspective, any research discussing the military capabilities of potential adversaries, like China and Russia, is relevant, but also increases risk because it could be used against the U.S. The involvement of authors with backgrounds in the U.S. Air Force, intelligence, and national security strengthens the military focus. Given the RAND corporation is a US based think tank, it is likely that this is primarily for US use, and is not primarily about foreign military development, so the risk is lower than other possibilities.",

        "abstract": "Frontier models have either been language-only or have primarily focused on vision and language modalities. Although recent advancements in models with vision and audio understanding capabilities have shown substantial progress, the field lacks a standardized evaluation framework for thoroughly assessing their cross-modality perception performance. We introduce MAVERIX (Multimodal Audio-Visual Evaluation Reasoning IndeX), a novel benchmark with 700 videos and 2,556 questions explicitly designed to evaluate multimodal models through tasks that necessitate close integration of video and audio information. MAVERIX uniquely provides models with audiovisual tasks, closely mimicking the multimodal perceptual experiences available to humans during inference and decision-making processes. To our knowledge, MAVERIX is the first benchmark aimed explicitly at assessing comprehensive audiovisual integration. Experiments with state-of-the-art models, including Gemini 1.5 Pro and o1, show performance approaching human levels (around 70% accuracy), while human experts reach near-ceiling performance (95.1%). With standardized evaluation protocols, a rigorously annotated pipeline, and a public toolkit (maverix-benchmark.github.io), MAVERIX establishes a challenging testbed for advancing audio-visual multimodal intelligence.",

Its relevance to military applications stems from the potential use of such models in autonomous systems, such as drones or surveillance systems, where the ability to understand and reason about audio-visual data is crucial. The presence of Computer Vision and Robotics as research interests and the involvement of CMU, which often has defense contracts, could be of concern. Specifically, the focus on multimodal understanding through audio-visual tasks could be utilized for object detection and scene understanding in military contexts. However, the paper itself does not explicitly mention any military applications, and the affiliations of the authors, with the exception of Ce Zheng, do not present any immediate military connections. The primary area of concern is the application of the technology to autonomous systems.",

        "abstract": "The effect of the electron-electron cusp on the convergence of configuration interaction (CI) wave functions is examined. By analogy with the pseudopotential approach for electron-ion interactions, an effective electron-electron interaction is developed which closely reproduces the scattering of the Coulomb interaction but is smooth and finite at zero electron-electron separation. The exact many-electron wave function for this smooth effective interaction has no cusp at zero electron-electron separation. We perform Cl and quantum Monte Carlo calculations for He and Be atoms, both with the Coulomb electron-electron interaction and with the smooth effective electron-electron interaction. We find that convergence of the CI expansion of the wave function for the smooth electron-electron interaction is not significantly improved compared with that for the divergent Coulomb interaction for energy differences on the order of 1 mHartree. This shows that, contrary to popular belief, description of the electron-electron cusp is not a limiting factor, to within chemical accuracy, for Cl calculations.",

        "abstract": "Blind inverse problems in imaging arise from uncertainties in the system used to collect (noisy) measurements of images. Recovering clean images from these measurements typically requires identifying the imaging system, either implicitly or explicitly. A common solution leverages generative models as priors for both the images and the imaging system parameters (e.g., a class of point spread functions). To learn these priors in a straightforward manner requires access to a dataset of clean images as well as samples of the imaging system. We propose an AmbientGAN-based generative technique to identify the distribution of parameters in unknown imaging systems, using only unpaired clean images and corrupted measurements. This learned distribution can then be used in model-based recovery algorithms to solve blind inverse problems such as blind deconvolution. We successfully demonstrate our technique for learning Gaussian blur and motion blur priors from noisy measurements and show their utility in solving blind deconvolution with diffusion posterior sampling.",

The method's ability to work with unknown imaging systems is particularly valuable in this context.\n2.  **Medical Imaging:** While the paper's direct focus is not on medical applications, one of the author's affiliations is with Dell Medical School, and there is the potential for the technology to be adapted for military medical imaging, such as improving the quality of images taken in the field.\n3.  **Secure Communications:** Kannan Ramchandran's background in distributed systems and coding could be relevant if this technology is used to improve secure data transmission.\n\nHowever, the paper's core technology does not explicitly target military applications. There is no direct indication that the research is funded by or conducted for military purposes. The lack of explicit military connections for most authors and the focus on generic image processing tasks, along with the U.S. publication country, mitigates the risk.

        "abstract": "Since the 2004 DARPA Grand Challenge, the autonomous driving technology has witnessed nearly two decades of rapid development. Particularly, in recent years, with the application of new sensors and deep learning technologies extending to the autonomous field, the development of autonomous driving technology has continued to make breakthroughs. Thus, many carmakers and high-tech giants dedicated to research and system development of autonomous driving. However, as the foundation of autonomous driving, the deep learning technology faces many new security risks. The academic community has proposed deep learning countermeasures against the adversarial examples and AI backdoor, and has introduced them into the autonomous driving field for verification. Deep learning security matters to autonomous driving system security, and then matters to personal safety, which is an issue that deserves attention and research.This paper provides an summary of the concepts, developments and recent research in deep learning security technologies in autonomous driving. Firstly, we briefly introduce the deep learning framework and pipeline in the autonomous driving system, which mainly include the deep learning technologies and algorithms commonly used in this field. Moreover, we focus on the potential security threats of the deep learning based autonomous driving system in each functional layer in turn. We reviews the development of deep learning attack technologies to autonomous driving, investigates the State-of-the-Art algorithms, and reveals the potential risks. At last, we provides an outlook on deep learning security in the autonomous driving field and proposes recommendations for building a safe and trustworthy autonomous driving system.",

While simulations and simulators are very important for the final product landing of the autonomous delivery robots since the autonomous delivery robots need to navigate on the sidewalk, campus, and other urban scenarios, where the simulations can avoid real damage to pedestrians and properties in the real world caused by any algorithm failures and programming errors and thus accelerate the whole developing procedure and cut down the cost. In this case, this study proposes an open-source simulator based on our autonomous delivery robot ZebraT to accelerate the research on autonomous delivery. The simulator developing procedure is illustrated step by step. What is more, the applications on the simulator that we are working on are also introduced, which includes autonomous navigation in the simulated urban environment, cooperation between an autonomous vehicle and an autonomous delivery robot, and reinforcement learning practice on the task training in the simulator. We have published the proposed simulator in Github.",

        "abstract": "Current autonomous building research primarily focuses on energy efficiency and automation. While traditional artificial intelligence has advanced autonomous building research, it often relies on predefined rules and struggles to adapt to complex, evolving building operations. Moreover, the centralized organizational structures of facilities management hinder transparency in decision-making, limiting true building autonomy. Research on decentralized governance and adaptive building infrastructure, which could overcome these challenges, remains relatively unexplored. This paper addresses these limitations by introducing a novel Decentralized Autonomous Building Cyber-Physical System framework that integrates Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, Large Language Models, and digital twins to create a smart, self-managed, operational, and financially autonomous building infrastructure. This study develops a full-stack decentralized application to facilitate decentralized governance of building infrastructure. An LLM-based artificial intelligence assistant is developed to provide intuitive human-building interaction for blockchain and building operation management-related tasks and enable autonomous building operation. Six real-world scenarios were tested to evaluate the autonomous building system's workability, including building revenue and expense management, AI-assisted facility control, and autonomous adjustment of building systems. Results indicate that the prototype successfully executes these operations, confirming the framework's suitability for developing building infrastructure with decentralized governance and autonomous operation.",

Wherever possible sufficient conditions are obtained for the results to hold true.

By letting a $\\mathfrak{dp}$-valued functor be (classical) quantum whenever every its value is a dynamical pattern whose set map takes values in the set of (commutative) noncommutative topological unital $\\ast-$algebras, and letting a (classical) quantum $0$-species be a $\\mathfrak{Chdv}_{0}$-valued functor factorizing through the canonical functor from $\\mathfrak{dp}$ to $\\mathfrak{Chdv}_{0}$ into a (classical) quantum $\\mathfrak{dp}$-valued functor, we have that the domain and codomain of $\\mathfrak{J}$ are a classical and a quantum $0$-species respectively.",

By analogy with the pseudopotential approach for electron-ion interactions, an effective electron-electron interaction is developed which closely reproduces the scattering of the Coulomb interaction but is smooth and finite at zero electron-electron separation. The exact many-electron wave function for this smooth effective interaction has no cusp at zero electron-electron separation. We perform CI and quantum Monte Carlo calculations for He and Be atoms, both with the Coulomb electron-electron interaction and with the smooth effective electron-electron interaction. We find that convergence of the CI expansion of the wave function for the smooth electron-electron interaction is not significantly improved compared with that for the divergent Coulomb interaction for energy differences on the order of 1 mHartree. This shows that, contrary to popular belief, description of the electron-electron cusp is not a limiting factor, to within chemical accuracy, for CI calculations.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present an integrated human-in-the-loop simulation paradigm for the design and evaluation of a lower extremity exoskeleton that is elastically strapped onto human lower limbs. The exoskeleton has 3 rotational DOFs on each side and weighs 23kg. Two torque compensation controllers of the exoskeleton are introduced, aiming to minimize interference and maximize assistance to human motions, respectively. Their effects on the wearer's biomechanical loadings are studied with a running motion and predicted ground reaction forces. It is found that the added weight of the passive exoskeleton substantially increases the wearer's musculoskeletal loadings. The maximizing assistance controller reduces the knee joint torque by almost a half when compared to the passive exoskeleton and the resultant torque is only 72% of that from the normal running without exoskeleton. When compared to the normal running, this controller also reduces the hip flexion and extension torques by 31% and 38%, respectively. As a result, the peak activations of the biceps short head, gluteus maximus, and rectus femoris muscles are reduced by more than a half. Nonetheless, the axial knee joint reaction force increases for all exoskeleton cases due to the added weight and higher GRFs. In summary, the results provide sound evidence of the efficacy of these two controllers on reducing the wearer's musculoskeletal loadings when compared to the passive exoskeleton. And it is shown the human-in-the-loop simulation paradigm presented here can be used for virtual design and evaluation of powered exoskeletons and pave the way for building optimized exoskeleton prototypes for experimental evaluation.",

The controllers are designed to minimize interference and maximize assistance, which directly benefits military applications. The mention of human-in-the-loop simulation for virtual design and evaluation further suggests potential for rapid prototyping and adaptation for military needs. Xinyu Chen's background in urban defense, even if historical, might contribute to understanding urban combat scenarios. The fact that the research has been funded by US military organizations further cements its relevance.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an insole FSR (Force Sensing Resistor) to dynamically detect weight variations in an exoskeleton system. The proposed methodology is intended for tasks of lifting and lowering heavy weights with an industrial exoskeleton to substantially reduce spinal loads during these manual handling activities. Instead of extensively placing high-dense force sensors by covering the whole plantar area, as most of commercial applications do, we integrate only a few force sensors in specific plantar area, so that the sensory system is not restricted to an individual foot size and shape, and on the other hand has relatively lower material cost. Industrial exoskeletons are intended to assist workers when handling heavy goods. With this in mind, wearers are not able to use their hands to control the exoskeleton since they use them to handle the goods. Therefore, the exoskeleton controller is required to indirectly infer how much and when the wearer requires assistance for lifting or lowering a heavy weight. Our approach of dynamically detect and characterize the increment/decrement of weight, as well as the rising/falling edge, enables the exoskeleton's controller to trigger the request of assistive force to the actuators.",

Clinical studies on post-stroke rehabilitation have shown that adapting assistive or haptic applications into physical therapy sessions significantly improves the motor learning and treatment process. The recent technology can lead to the creation of generic hand exoskeletons that are application-agnostic. In this paper, our motivation is to create guidelines and best practices for generic exoskeletons by reviewing the literature of current devices. First, we describe each application and briefly explain their design requirements, and then list the design selections to achieve these requirements. Then, we detail each selection by investigating the existing exoskeletons based on their design choices, and by highlighting their impact on application types. With the motivation of creating efficient generic exoskeletons in the future, we finally summarize the best practices in the literature.",

Twelve healthy male participants performed an assembly task under three conditions: standing and high and low sitting while wearing the exoskeleton. We mainly analyzed the joint compression force computed using the musculoskeletal model based on measurements obtained from a motion capture system and force platform. While wearing the exoskeleton, the lumbar joint compression force increased. Analysis of the joint compression force can determine the increase in the lumbar load when wearing an exoskeleton, which is not possible using the traditional analysis of posture and muscular activity. Therefore, biomechanical analysis based on a full-body musculoskeletal model provides valuable information in evaluating the effect of the exoskeleton that attempts to prevent musculoskeletal disorders.",

However, for the assistance of tasks differing from lifting, back-support exoskeletons potential has not been exploited extensively. This work focuses on the use of an active back-support exoskeleton to assist carrying. Two control strategies are designed that modulate the exoskeleton torques to comply with the task assistance requirements. In particular, two gait phase detection frameworks are exploited to adapt the assistance according to the legs' motion. The two strategies are assessed through an experimental analysis on ten subjects. Carrying task is performed without and with the exoskeleton assistance. Results prove the potential of the presented controls in assisting the task without hindering the gait movement and improving the usability experienced by users. Moreover, the exoskeleton assistance significantly reduces the lumbar load associated with the task, demonstrating its promising use for risk mitigation in the workplace.",

The risk of the technology being used for foreign military purposes is elevated, but the direct military relevance is unclear. The topics listed, like robotics and autonomous systems, are common, which lowers the risk score. Overall, this paper may have potential military applications, but the risk score is moderate due to the unknown nature of military applications.

How the ethical\nguidelines can be integrated into the development process has not been widely\nstudied. However, this is one of the most important topics which should be\nstudied more in real-life applications. Therefore, in this paper we highlight\none ethical concern in the context of an exoskeleton used to train a user to\nperform a gesture: during the interaction between the exoskeleton, patient and\ntherapist, how is the responsibility for decision making distributed? Based on\nthe outcome of this, we will discuss how to integrate ethical guidelines into\nthe development process of an AI-based exoskeleton. The discussion is based on\na case study: AiBle. The different technical factors affecting the\nrehabilitation results and the human-machine interaction for AI-based\nexoskeletons are identified and discussed in this paper in order to better\napply the ethical guidelines during the development of AI-based exoskeletons.",

The potential dual-use nature of the technology, combined with the PLA affiliation and the unknown publish country, raises concerns about the paper's military applications, particularly from a US perspective. The presence of a researcher at the PLA suggests the possibility of the research being used to develop military exoskeleton technology, increasing the risk level.",

        "abstract": "The concept of jamming has attracted great research interest due to its broad relevance in soft matter such as liquids, glasses, colloids, foams, and granular materials, and its deep connection to the sphere packing problem and optimization problems. Here we show that the domain of amorphous jammed states of frictionless spheres can be significantly extended, from the well-known jamming-point at a fixed density, to a jamming-plane that spans the density and shear strain axes. We explore the jamming-plane, via athermal and thermal simulations of compression and shear jamming, with a help of an efficient swap algorithm to prepare initial equilibrium configurations. The jamming-plane can be divided into reversible-jamming and irreversible-jamming regimes, based on the reversibility of the route from the initial configuration to jamming. Our results suggest that the irreversible-jamming behavior reflects an escape from the meta-stable glass basin to which the initial configuration belongs to, or the absence of such basins. All jammed states, either compression or shear jammed, are isostatic, and exhibit jamming criticality of the same universality class. However, the anisotropy of contact networks non-trivially depends on the jamming density and strain. Among all state points on the jamming-plane, the jamming-point is a unique one with the minimum jamming density and the maximum randomness. For lattice packings, the jamming-plane shrinks into a single shear jamming-line that is independent of initial configurations. Our study paves the way for solving the long-standing random close packing problem, and provides a more complete framework to understand jamming.",

One of the fundamental challenges in designing defense mechanisms against\nan advanced jammer is understanding which jamming strategies yields the lowest\nthroughput, for a given channel condition and a given amount of energy. To the\nbest of our knowledge, this problem still remains unsolved. To fill this gap,\nin this paper we conduct a comparative analysis of several most viable advanced\njamming schemes in the widely-used MIMO networks. We first mathematically model\na number of advanced jamming schemes at the signal processing level, so that a\nquantitative relationship between the jamming energy and the jamming effect is\nestablished. Based on the model, theorems are derived on the optimal advanced\njamming scheme for an arbitrary channel condition. The theoretical findings are\nvalidated through extensive simulations and experiments on a 5-radio 2x2 MIMO\ntestbed. Our results show that the theorems are able to predict jamming\nefficiency with high accuracy. Moreover, we show that the theorems can be\nincorporated to state-of-art reinforcement learning based jamming algorithms\nand boost the action exploration phase so that a faster convergence is\nachieved.",

        "abstract": "Jamming is a ubiquitous phenomenon that appears in many soft matter systems, including granular materials, foams, colloidal suspensions, emulsions, polymers, and cells -- when jamming occurs, the system undergoes a transition from flow-like to solid-like states. Conventionally, the jamming transition occurs when the system reaches a threshold jamming density under isotropic compression, but recent studies reveal that jamming can also be induced by shear. Shear jamming has attracted much interest in the context of non-equilibrium phase transitions, mechanics and rheology of amorphous materials. Here we review the phenomenology of shear jamming and its related physics. We first describe basic observations obtained in experiments and simulations, and results from theories. Shear jamming is then demonstrated as a \"bridge\" that connects the rheology of athermal soft spheres and thermal hard spheres. Based on a generalized jamming phase diagram, a universal description is provided for shear jamming in frictionless and frictional systems. We further review the isostaticity and criticality of the shear jamming transition, and the elasticity of shear jammed solids. The broader relevance of shear jamming is discussed, including its relation to other phenomena such as shear hardening, dilatancy, fragility, and discrete shear thickening.",

        "abstract": "We study properties of jammed packings of frictionless spheres over a wide range of volume fractions. There exists a crossover volume fraction which separates deeply jammed solids from marginally jammed solids. In deeply jammed solids, all the scalings presented in marginally jammed solids are replaced with remarkably different ones with potential independent exponents. Correspondingly, there are structural changes in the pair distribution function associated with the crossover. The normal modes of vibration of deeply jammed solids also exhibit some anomalies, e.g. strengthened quasi-localization and absence of Debye-like density of states at low frequencies. Deeply jammed systems may thus be cataloged to a new class of amorphous solids.",

        "title": "Recurrent Neural Network-based Anti-jamming Framework for Defense Against Multiple Jamming Policies",
        "abstract": "Conventional anti-jamming methods mainly focus on preventing single jammer attacks with an invariant jamming policy or jamming attacks from multiple jammers with similar jamming policies. These anti-jamming methods are ineffective against a single jammer following several different jamming policies or multiple jammers with distinct policies. Therefore, this paper proposes an anti-jamming method that can adapt its policy to the current jamming attack. Moreover, for the multiple jammers scenario, an anti-jamming method that estimates the future occupied channels using the jammers' occupied channels in previous time slots is proposed. In both single and multiple jammers scenarios, the interaction between the users and jammers is modeled using recurrent neural networks (RNN)s. The performance of the proposed anti-jamming methods is evaluated by calculating the users' successful transmission rate (STR) and ergodic rate (ER), and compared to a baseline based on Q-learning (DQL). Simulation results show that for the single jammer scenario, all the considered jamming policies are perfectly detected and high STR and ER are maintained. Moreover, when 70 % of the spectrum is under jamming attacks from multiple jammers, the proposed method achieves an STR and ER greater than 75 % and 80 %, respectively. These values rise to 90 % when 30 % of the spectrum is under jamming attacks. In addition, the proposed anti-jamming methods significantly outperform the DQL method for all the considered cases and jamming scenarios.",

        "title": "Jamming Attacks and Anti-Jamming Strategies in Wireless Networks: A  Comprehensive Survey",
        "abstract": "  Wireless networks are a key component of the telecommunications infrastructure in our society, and wireless services become increasingly important as the applications of wireless devices have penetrated every aspect of our lives. Although wireless technologies have significantly advanced in the past decades, most wireless networks are still vulnerable to radio jamming attacks due to the openness nature of wireless channels, and the progress in the design of jamming-resistant wireless networking systems remains limited. This stagnation can be attributed to the lack of practical physical-layer wireless technologies that can efficiently decode data packets in the presence of jamming attacks. This article surveys existing jamming attacks and anti-jamming strategies in wireless local area networks (WLANs), cellular networks, cognitive radio networks (CRNs), ZigBee networks, Bluetooth networks, vehicular networks, LoRa networks, RFID networks, and GPS system, with the objective of offering a comprehensive knowledge landscape of existing jamming/anti-jamming strategies and stimulating more research efforts to secure wireless networks against jamming attacks. Different from prior survey papers, this article conducts a comprehensive, in-depth review on jamming and anti-jamming strategies, casting insights on the design of jamming-resilient wireless networking systems. An outlook on promising antijamming techniques is offered at the end of this article to delineate important research directions.",

Wireless communication is crucial for modern military operations, and the ability to disrupt or secure these communications is of paramount importance. The authors' affiliations and funding from the US Army Research Office further indicate a strong military interest in this research. Specifically, the paper's focus on various wireless networks, including those used in military communications, makes it highly applicable. Given the potential for the technology to be used to disrupt US communications or be used against US interests by foreign adversaries, the risk score is elevated.",

We compute the exponents associated with the small force distribution and the interparticle gap distribution,and show that the corresponding exponents are consistent with the marginal stability condition observed for isotropic jamming, and with predictions of the mean field theory of jamming in hard spheres.",

Specifically, the study of how these materials behave under shear stress and their marginal stability can inform the design of new materials with enhanced mechanical properties. These improved material properties can be used in US military applications like advanced armor, protective gear, and in materials deployed in extreme conditions, such as those experienced by satellites or drones. The author's affiliation with research institutions in India, and potential funding of another paper by an Army Research Office, does introduce a low risk, particularly given the potential for dual-use applications or knowledge transfer to foreign entities. However, the core research area is fundamental and doesn't inherently suggest a high degree of military applicability without significant further development. Additionally, there are no clear links to military research in the authors' backgrounds, further reducing the overall risk.",

Due to the wireless broadcasting nature and the energy constraint of physical objects, concerns on IoT security have triggered research on cooperative jamming based physical layer security. With the help of a cooperative jammer, existing solutions can effectively fight against eavesdroppers. However, these schemes are of high energy cost due to continuously transmitting jamming signals. To reduce the energy consumption, we propose a new idea of intermittent jamming and design five specific intermittent jamming schemes (IJSs). By taking the transmit frame formate into account, we optimize these IJSs from three aspects, including the jamming power, the jamming method, and the jamming positions. Then we analyze the applicability of the proposed IJSs according to different requirements on the synchronization, the available jamming energy and the jamming power constraints. Extensive MATLAB experiments are conducted on the basis of the WLAN Toolbox, which demonstrate the proposed IJSs can effectively degrade the reception of the eavesdropper and outperform the widespread continuous jamming scheme (CJS) when the available jamming energy is limited.",

In this paper, we present a study of jamming attacks in elastic optical networks (EON) by embedding the jamming into the physical layer model, and we analyze its impact on the blocking probability and slots utilization. We evaluate our proposed model using a single link and a network topology and we show that for in-band-jamming, the slots utilization decreases with the increase of jamming power, and becomes null when the jamming power is higher than 3 dB, while for out-of-band jamming, the impact is maximal for a specific jamming power, 1.75 dB in our simulation. Considering multiple positions of attackers, we attained the highest blocking probability 32% for a specific jamming power 2 dB. We conclude that the impact of jamming depends on attacker positions as well as the jamming power.",

However, the SE of wireless communications is severely degraded under co-frequency and co-mode hostile jamming. Focused on this issue, we propose a novel OAM active anti-jamming scheme to significantly enhance the anti-jamming results of wireless communications under broadband hostile jamming. Specifically, the OAM transmitter with energy detection senses jamming signals to identify which OAM modes are jammed and unjammed. Based on the recognition of OAM modes, useful signals are modulated by reflecting the received co-frequency and co-mode jamming signals with the assistance of a programmable gain amplifier (PGA) to the OAM receiver, thus utilizing both the OAM modes jammed by hostile attacks and the energy of jamming signals. Meanwhile, the unjammed OAM modes allocated with total transmit power are multiplexed for useful signal transmission. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed OAM active anti-jamming scheme can achieve high OAM mode utilization and significantly increase the SEs.",

The studied control plane considers that the jammed connections can be detected and avoided. We used a physical layer model, in which we embedded the additional jamming power, to evaluate different security in scenarios, such as a jamming-free scenario, jamming with an unaware controller, and jamming with an aware controller. The performance is analyzed in terms of the blocking rate and slots utilization. We analyze the impact of jamming attacks in the least used link and in the most used link on the network. The results demonstrates that the jamming avoidance by the control plane can reach performance near the not jammed scenario.",

This review discusses a number of aspects of these applications, including selected topics and concepts in nuclear reactor physics, nuclear fusion, nuclear non-proliferation, nuclear-geophysics, and nuclear medicine. The review begins with a historic summary of the early years in applied nuclear physics, with an emphasis on the huge developments that took place around the time of World War II, and that underlie the physics involved in designs of nuclear explosions, controlled nuclear energy, and nuclear fusion. The review then moves to focus on modern applications of these concepts, including the basic concepts and diagnostics developed for the forensics of nuclear explosions, the nuclear diagnostics at the National Ignition Facility, nuclear reactor safeguards, and the detection of nuclear material production and trafficking. The review also summarizes recent developments in nuclear geophysics and nuclear medicine. The nuclear geophysics areas discussed include geo-chronology, nuclear logging for industry, the Oklo reactor, and geo-neutrinos. The section on nuclear medicine summarizes the critical advances in nuclear imaging, including PET and SPECT imaging, targeted radionuclide therapy, and the nuclear physics of medical isotope production. Each subfield discussed requires a review article onto itself, which is not the intention of the current review. Rather, the current review is intended for readers who wish to get a broad understanding of applied nuclear physics.",

The author Ang Li has no clear military connections, however the mention of other author Li Ang Zhang, affiliated with the RAND corporation, further suggests that the academic background is relevant to military contexts. Furthermore, the focus on topics relevant to nuclear physics inherently increases the risk profile due to the sensitive nature of the subject matter.",

In this lecture note, after a brief summary of the\ncurrently available constraints on nuclear symmetry energy near the saturation\ndensity we first discuss the relationship between the symmetry energy and the\nisopin and momentum dependence of the single-nucleon potential in\nisospin-asymmetric nuclear medium. We then discuss several open issues\nregarding effects of the tensor force induced neutron-proton short-range\ncorrelation (SRC) on nuclear symmetry energy. Finally, as an example of the\nimpacts of nuclear symmetry energy on properties of neutron stars and\ngravitational waves, we illustrate effects of the high-density symmetry energy\non the tidal polarizability of neutron stars in coalescing binaries.",

        "abstract": "Sonar image synthesis is crucial for advancing applications in underwater exploration, marine biology, and defence. Traditional methods often rely on extensive and costly data collection using sonar sensors, jeopardizing data quality and diversity. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes a new sonar image synthesis framework, Synth-SONAR leveraging diffusion models and GPT prompting. The key novelties of Synth-SONAR are threefold: First, by integrating Generative AI-based style injection techniques along with publicly available real/simulated data, thereby producing one of the largest sonar data corpus for sonar research. Second, a dual text-conditioning sonar diffusion model hierarchy synthesizes coarse and fine-grained sonar images with enhanced quality and diversity. Third, high-level (coarse) and low-level (detailed) text-based sonar generation methods leverage advanced semantic information available in visual language models (VLMs) and GPT-prompting. During inference, the method generates diverse and realistic sonar images from textual prompts, bridging the gap between textual descriptions and sonar image generation. This marks the application of GPT-prompting in sonar imagery for the first time, to the best of our knowledge. Synth-SONAR achieves state-of-the-art results in producing high-quality synthetic sonar datasets, significantly enhancing their diversity and realism.",

Efficient and integrative analysis of these data, either across different sonar instruments or with other oceanographic datasets, holds the key to understanding the response of marine ecosystems to the rapidly changing climate. Here we present Echopype, an open-source Python software library designed to address this need. By standardizing water column sonar data from diverse instruments following a community convention and utilizing the widely embraced netCDF data model to encode sonar data as labeled, multi-dimensional arrays, Echopype facilitates intuitive, user-friendly exploration and use of sonar data in an instrument-agnostic manner. By leveraging existing open-source Python libraries optimized for distributed computing, Echopype directly enables computational interoperability and scalability in both local and cloud computing environments. Echopype's modularized package structure further provides a conceptually unified implementation framework for expanding its support for additional instrument raw data formats and incorporating new data analysis functionalities. We envision the continued development of Echopype as a catalyst for making information derived from water column sonar data an integrated component of regional and global ocean observation strategies.",

        "abstract": "In the field of deep-sea exploration, sonar is presently the only efficient long-distance sensing device. The complicated underwater environment, such as noise interference, low target intensity or background dynamics, has brought many negative effects on sonar imaging. Among them, the problem of nonlinear intensity is extremely prevalent. It is also known as the anisotropy of acoustic sensor imaging, that is, when autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) carry sonar to detect the same target from different angles, the intensity variation between image pairs is sometimes very large, which makes the traditional matching algorithm almost ineffective. However, image matching is the basis of comprehensive tasks such as navigation, positioning, and mapping. Therefore, it is very valuable to obtain robust and accurate matching results. This paper proposes a combined matching method based on phase information and deep convolution features. It has two outstanding advantages: one is that the deep convolution features could be used to measure the similarity of the local and global positions of the sonar image; the other is that local feature matching could be performed at the key target position of the sonar image. This method does not need complex manual designs, and completes the matching task of nonlinear intensity sonar images in a close end-to-end manner. Feature matching experiments are carried out on the deep-sea sonar images captured by AUVs, and the results show that our proposal has preeminent matching accuracy and robustness.",

For underwater robotics, it is of great interest to design computer vision algorithms to improve perception capabilities such as sonar image classification. Due to the confidential nature of sonar imaging and the difficulty to interpret sonar images, it is challenging to create public large labeled sonar datasets to train supervised learning algorithms. In this work, we investigate the potential of three self-supervised learning methods (RotNet, Denoising Autoencoders, and Jigsaw) to learn high-quality sonar image representation without the need of human labels. We present pre-training and transfer learning results on real-life sonar image datasets. Our results indicate that self-supervised pre-training yields classification performance comparable to supervised pre-training in a few-shot transfer learning setup across all three methods.

We introduce SONIC (SONar Image Correspondence), a pose-supervised network designed to yield robust feature correspondence capable of withstanding viewpoint variations. The inherent complexity of the underwater environment stems from the dynamic and frequently limited visibility conditions, restricting vision to a few meters of often featureless expanses. This makes camera-based systems suboptimal in most open water application scenarios. Consequently, multibeam imaging sonars emerge as the preferred choice for perception sensors. However, they too are not without their limitations. While imaging sonars offer superior long-range visibility compared to cameras, their measurements can appear different from varying viewpoints. This inherent variability presents formidable challenges in data association, particularly for feature-based methods. Our method demonstrates significantly better performance in generating correspondences for sonar images which will pave the way for more accurate loop closure constraints and sonar-based place recognition. Code as well as simulated and real-world datasets will be made public to facilitate further development in the field.",

        "abstract": "This article focuses on feature-based underwater localization and navigation for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) using 2D imaging sonar measurements. The sparsity of underwater acoustic features and the loss of elevation angle in sonar images may introduce wrong feature matches or insufficient features for optimization-based underwater localization (i.e. under-constrained/degeneracy cases). This motivates us to propose a novel inertial-aided sliding window optimization framework to improve the estimation accuracy and the robustness to front-end outliers. Concretely, we first discriminate under-constrained/ well-constrained sonar frames and define sonar keyframes (SKFs) based on the Jacobian matrix derived from odometry and sonar measurements. To utilize the past well-constrained SKFs mostly, we design a size-adjustable windowed back-end optimization scheme based on singular values. We also prove that the landmark triangulation failure (navigation problem) caused by sonar motion can be solved in 2D scenes. Comparative simulation and evaluation on a public dataset show the proposed method outperforms the existing ones in pose estimation and robustness even without loop closure and also ensures the real-time performance for online applications.",

In the field of underwater vision, sonar is currently the most effective long-distance detection sensor, it has excellent performances in map building and target search tasks. However, the traditional image matching algorithms are all developed based on optical images. In order to solve this contradiction, the style transfer method is used to convert the sonar images into optical styles, and at the same time, the learned descriptor with excellent expressiveness for sonar images matching is introduced.

This paper proposes a robust and efficient imaging SONAR based place recognition, SONAR context, and loop closure method. Unlike previous methods, our approach encodes geometric information based on the characteristics of raw SONAR measurements without prior knowledge or training. We also design a hierarchical searching procedure for fast retrieval of candidate SONAR frames and apply adaptive shifting and padding to achieve robust matching on rotation and translation changes. In addition, we can derive the initial pose through adaptive shifting and apply it to the iterative closest point (ICP) based loop closure factor. We evaluate the performance of SONAR context in the various underwater sequences such as simulated open water, real water tank, and real underwater environments. The proposed approach shows the robustness and improvements of place recognition on various datasets and evaluation metrics.

The key challenges include non-uniform lighting and poor visibility in turbid environments. High-frequency forward-look sonar cameras address these issues, by providing high-resolution imagery at maximum range of tens of meters, despite complexities posed by high degree of speckle noise, and lack of color and texture. In particular, robust feature detection is an essential initial step for automated object recognition, localization, navigation, and 3-D mapping. Various local feature detectors developed for RGB images are not well-suited for sonar data. To assess their performances, we evaluate a number of feature detectors using real sonar images from five different sonar devices. Performance metrics such as detection accuracy, false positives, and robustness to variations in target characteristics and sonar devices are applied to analyze the experimental results. The study would provide a deeper insight into the bottlenecks of feature detection for sonar data, and developing more effective methods",

        "abstract": "With the continuous development of underwater vision technology, more and more remote sensing images could be obtained. In the underwater scene, sonar sensors are currently the most effective remote perception devices, and the sonar images captured by them could provide rich environment information. In order to analyze a certain scene, we often need to merge the sonar images from different periods, various sonar frequencies and distinctive viewpoints. However, the above scenes will bring nonlinear intensity differences to the sonar images, which will make traditional matching methods almost ineffective. This paper proposes a non-linear intensity sonar image matching method that combines local feature points and deep convolution features. This method has two key advantages: (i) we generate data samples related to local feature points based on the self-learning idea; (ii) we use the convolutional neural network (CNN) and Siamese network architecture to measure the similarity of the local position in the sonar image pair. Our method encapsulates the feature extraction and feature matching stage in a model, and directly learns the mapping function from image patch pairs to matching labels, and achieves matching tasks in a near-end-to-end manner. Feature matching experiments are carried out on the sonar images acquired by autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) in the real underwater environment. Experiment results show that our method has better matching effects and strong robustness.",
