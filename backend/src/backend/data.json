Particularly, in recent years, with the application of new sensors and deep learning technologies extending to the autonomous field, the development of autonomous driving technology has continued to make breakthroughs. Thus, many carmakers and high-tech giants dedicated to research and system development of autonomous driving. However, as the foundation of autonomous driving, the deep learning technology faces many new security risks. The academic community has proposed deep learning countermeasures against the adversarial examples and AI backdoor, and has introduced them into the autonomous driving field for verification. Deep learning security matters to autonomous driving system security, and then matters to personal safety, which is an issue that deserves attention and research.This paper provides an summary of the concepts, developments and recent research in deep learning security technologies in autonomous driving. Firstly, we briefly introduce the deep learning framework and pipeline in the autonomous driving system, which mainly include the deep learning technologies and algorithms commonly used in this field. Moreover, we focus on the potential security threats of the deep learning based autonomous driving system in each functional layer in turn. We reviews the development of deep learning attack technologies to autonomous driving, investigates the State-of-the-Art algorithms, and reveals the potential risks. At last, we provides an outlook on deep learning security in the autonomous driving field and proposes recommendations for building a safe and trustworthy autonomous driving system.",

While traditional artificial intelligence has advanced autonomous building research, it often relies on predefined rules and struggles to adapt to complex, evolving building operations. Moreover, the centralized organizational structures of facilities management hinder transparency in decision-making, limiting true building autonomy. Research on decentralized governance and adaptive building infrastructure, which could overcome these challenges, remains relatively unexplored. This paper addresses these limitations by introducing a novel Decentralized Autonomous Building Cyber-Physical System framework that integrates Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, Large Language Models, and digital twins to create a smart, self-managed, operational, and financially autonomous building infrastructure. This study develops a full-stack decentralized application to facilitate decentralized governance of building infrastructure. An LLM-based artificial intelligence assistant is developed to provide intuitive human-building interaction for blockchain and building operation management-related tasks and enable autonomous building operation. Six real-world scenarios were tested to evaluate the autonomous building system's workability, including building revenue and expense management, AI-assisted facility control, and autonomous adjustment of building systems. Results indicate that the prototype successfully executes these operations, confirming the framework's suitability for developing building infrastructure with decentralized governance and autonomous operation.",

By analogy with the pseudopotential approach for electron-ion interactions, an effective electron-electron interaction is developed which closely reproduces the scattering of the Coulomb interaction but is smooth and finite at zero electron-electron separation. The exact many-electron wave function for this smooth effective interaction has no cusp at zero electron-electron separation. We perform CI and quantum Monte Carlo calculations for He and Be atoms, both with the Coulomb electron-electron interaction and with the smooth effective electron-electron interaction. We find that convergence of the CI expansion of the wave function for the smooth electron-electron interaction is not significantly improved compared with that for the divergent Coulomb interaction for energy differences on the order of 1 mHartree. This shows that, contrary to popular belief, description of the electron-electron cusp is not a limiting factor, to within chemical accuracy, for CI calculations.",

The exoskeleton has 3 rotational DOFs on each side and weighs 23kg. Two torque compensation controllers of the exoskeleton are introduced, aiming to minimize interference and maximize assistance to human motions, respectively. Their effects on the wearer's biomechanical loadings are studied with a running motion and predicted ground reaction forces. It is found that the added weight of the passive exoskeleton substantially increases the wearer's musculoskeletal loadings. The maximizing assistance controller reduces the knee joint torque by almost a half when compared to the passive exoskeleton and the resultant torque is only 72% of that from the normal running without exoskeleton. When compared to the normal running, this controller also reduces the hip flexion and extension torques by 31% and 38%, respectively. As a result, the peak activations of the biceps short head, gluteus maximus, and rectus femoris muscles are reduced by more than a half. Nonetheless, the axial knee joint reaction force increases for all exoskeleton cases due to the added weight and higher GRFs. In summary, the results provide sound evidence of the efficacy of these two controllers on reducing the wearer's musculoskeletal loadings when compared to the passive exoskeleton. And it is shown the human-in-the-loop simulation paradigm presented here can be used for virtual design and evaluation of powered exoskeletons and pave the way for building optimized exoskeleton prototypes for experimental evaluation.",

The proposed methodology is intended for tasks of lifting and lowering heavy weights with an industrial exoskeleton to substantially reduce spinal loads during these manual handling activities. Instead of extensively placing high-dense force sensors by covering the whole plantar area, as most of commercial applications do, we integrate only a few force sensors in specific plantar area, so that the sensory system is not restricted to an individual foot size and shape, and on the other hand has relatively lower material cost. Industrial exoskeletons are intended to assist workers when handling heavy goods. With this in mind, wearers are not able to use their hands to control the exoskeleton since they use them to handle the goods. Therefore, the exoskeleton controller is required to indirectly infer how much and when the wearer requires assistance for lifting or lowering a heavy weight. Our approach of dynamically detect and characterize the increment/decrement of weight, as well as the rising/falling edge, enables the exoskeleton's controller to trigger the request of assistive force to the actuators.",

It concludes that all jammed states are isostatic and share the same universality class.

    "paper_abstract": "The concept of jamming has attracted great research interest due to its broad relevance in soft matter such as liquids, glasses, colloids, foams, and granular materials, and its deep connection to the sphere packing problem and optimization problems. Here we show that the domain of amorphous jammed states of frictionless spheres can be significantly extended, from the well-known jamming-point at a fixed density, to a jamming-plane that spans the density and shear strain axes. We explore the jamming-plane, via athermal and thermal simulations of compression and shear jamming, with a help of an efficient swap algorithm to prepare initial equilibrium configurations. The jamming-plane can be divided into reversible-jamming and irreversible-jamming regimes, based on the reversibility of the route from the initial configuration to jamming. Our results suggest that the irreversible-jamming behavior reflects an escape from the meta-stable glass basin to which the initial configuration belongs to, or the absence of such basins. All jammed states, either compression or shear jammed, are isostatic, and exhibit jamming criticality of the same universality class. However, the anisotropy of contact networks non-trivially depends on the jamming density and strain. Among all state points on the jamming-plane, the jamming-point is a unique one with the minimum jamming density and the maximum randomness. For lattice packings, the jamming-plane shrinks into a single shear jamming-line that is independent of initial configurations. Our study paves the way for solving the long-standing random close packing problem, and provides a more complete framework to understand jamming.",

While the primary focus seems to be on fundamental physics, the paper's exploration of jamming could have military applications. Specifically, understanding and controlling the behavior of jammed materials could be relevant for applications like: \n\n*   **Protective Gear:** Developing advanced armor or impact-resistant materials. The paper's insights into the mechanical properties of jammed systems could inform the design of materials that can absorb and dissipate energy from impacts. \n*   **Structural Engineering:** Designing more resilient structures. Understanding how materials jam and unjam could be used to create more robust infrastructure, particularly for vehicles or fortifications. \n*   **Stealth Technology:** Jammed materials may potentially absorb or scatter electromagnetic radiation. This could be useful in designing stealth coatings or materials. \n\nGiven the involvement of Chinese researchers, and the potential for dual-use technologies, there is a risk of this knowledge being applied to military purposes.

The measurement of\nthe dynamical structure factor offers the chance to observe the evolution of\njams without the necessity to define a car to be jammed or not. Above the\njamming transition the dynamical structure factor exhibits for a given k-value\ntwo maxima corresponding to the separation of the system into the free flow\nphase and jammed phase. We obtain from a finite-size scaling analysis of the\nsmallest jam mode that approaching the transition long range correlations of\nthe jams occur.",

The research investigates long-range correlations and the dynamics of traffic jams. While the core topic is traffic, potential military applications could include optimization of logistics, transportation networks, and simulations of vehicle movement in various environments. The primary risk comes from the author K. D. Usadel having a potential connection to the United States Military Academy. However, the main topic, traffic flow models, is not inherently military-focused, and the research is from 1998. The authors' other research areas do not point to military applications, and the main focus is on the physics of the system.",

    "paper_abstract": "In advanced jamming, the adversary intentionally concentrates the available\nenergy budget on specific critical components (e.g., pilot symbols,\nacknowledgement packets, etc.) to (i) increase the jamming effectiveness, as\nmore targets can be jammed with the same energy budget; and (ii) decrease the\nlikelihood of being detected, as the channel is jammed for a shorter period of\ntime. One of the fundamental challenges in designing defense mechanisms against\nan advanced jammer is understanding which jamming strategies yields the lowest\nthroughput, for a given channel condition and a given amount of energy. To the\nbest of our knowledge, this problem still remains unsolved. To fill this gap,\nin this paper we conduct a comparative analysis of several most viable advanced\njamming schemes in the widely-used MIMO networks. We first mathematically model\na number of advanced jamming schemes at the signal processing level, so that a\nquantitative relationship between the jamming energy and the jamming effect is\nestablished. Based on the model, theorems are derived on the optimal advanced\njamming scheme for an arbitrary channel condition. The theoretical findings are\nvalidated through extensive simulations and experiments on a 5-radio 2x2 MIMO\ntestbed. Our results show that the theorems are able to predict jamming\nefficiency with high accuracy. Moreover, we show that the theorems can be\nincorporated to state-of-art reinforcement learning based jamming algorithms\nand boost the action exploration phase so that a faster convergence is\nachieved.",

The research includes modeling jamming schemes, deriving optimal jamming strategies, and validating these through experiments.

Liyang Zhang's work, while not explicitly tied to the military, contributes to wireless security which further increases the likelihood of military application. The fact that the paper is presumed to be published from Italy raises some risk concerns about the country it's published from and if the information may be used by adversaries, but the clear US military ties reduce this risk. Overall, the paper's focus on jamming attacks, combined with the affiliations and funding, indicates significant potential for military applications.",

    "paper_abstract": "Jamming is a ubiquitous phenomenon that appears in many soft matter systems, including granular materials, foams, colloidal suspensions, emulsions, polymers, and cells -- when jamming occurs, the system undergoes a transition from flow-like to solid-like states. Conventionally, the jamming transition occurs when the system reaches a threshold jamming density under isotropic compression, but recent studies reveal that jamming can also be induced by shear. Shear jamming has attracted much interest in the context of non-equilibrium phase transitions, mechanics and rheology of amorphous materials. Here we review the phenomenology of shear jamming and its related physics. We first describe basic observations obtained in experiments and simulations, and results from theories. Shear jamming is then demonstrated as a \"bridge\" that connects the rheology of athermal soft spheres and thermal hard spheres. Based on a generalized jamming phase diagram, a universal description is provided for shear jamming in frictionless and frictional systems. We further review the isostaticity and criticality of the shear jamming transition, and the elasticity of shear jammed solids. The broader relevance of shear jamming is discussed, including its relation to other phenomena such as shear hardening, dilatancy, fragility, and discrete shear thickening.",

There exists a crossover volume fraction which separates deeply jammed solids from marginally jammed solids. In deeply jammed solids, all the scalings presented in marginally jammed solids are replaced with remarkably different ones with potential independent exponents. Correspondingly, there are structural changes in the pair distribution function associated with the crossover. The normal modes of vibration of deeply jammed solids also exhibit some anomalies, e.g. strengthened quasi-localization and absence of Debye-like density of states at low frequencies. Deeply jammed systems may thus be cataloged to a new class of amorphous solids.",

    "paper_abstract": "Conventional anti-jamming methods mainly focus on preventing single jammer attacks with an invariant jamming policy or jamming attacks from multiple jammers with similar jamming policies. These anti-jamming methods are ineffective against a single jammer following several different jamming policies or multiple jammers with distinct policies. Therefore, this paper proposes an anti-jamming method that can adapt its policy to the current jamming attack. Moreover, for the multiple jammers scenario, an anti-jamming method that estimates the future occupied channels using the jammers' occupied channels in previous time slots is proposed. In both single and multiple jammers scenarios, the interaction between the users and jammers is modeled using recurrent neural networks (RNN)s. The performance of the proposed anti-jamming methods is evaluated by calculating the users' successful transmission rate (STR) and ergodic rate (ER), and compared to a baseline based on Q-learning (DQL). Simulation results show that for the single jammer scenario, all the considered jamming policies are perfectly detected and high STR and ER are maintained. Moreover, when 70 % of the spectrum is under jamming attacks from multiple jammers, the proposed method achieves an STR and ER greater than 75 % and 80 %, respectively. These values rise to 90 % when 30 % of the spectrum is under jamming attacks. In addition, the proposed anti-jamming methods significantly outperform the DQL method for all the considered cases and jamming scenarios.",

    "reasoning": "The research focuses on anti-jamming techniques using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to defend against communication disruptions, particularly in scenarios involving multiple jammers with diverse strategies. The core of the research lies in creating methods that are adaptive and can predict future channel occupancy. This has direct military relevance as it offers a defense against jamming attacks that can be used against the U.S. military's wireless communication systems. The use of AI and machine learning, coupled with the ability to maintain high successful transmission rates in the face of jamming, makes this technology applicable to military communications, drone control, and secure data transmission, increasing its military application risk. The research is from authors affiliated with Huawei, a company with ties to the Chinese government, which increases the risk of this technology being used against U.S. interests. Given the focus on cybersecurity, telecommunications and defense technology with the authors, along with the country of origin the risk score is high.",

    "paper_abstract": "  Wireless networks are a key component of the telecommunications infrastructure in our society, and wireless services become increasingly important as the applications of wireless devices have penetrated every aspect of our lives. Although wireless technologies have significantly advanced in the past decades, most wireless networks are still vulnerable to radio jamming attacks due to the openness nature of wireless channels, and the progress in the design of jamming-resistant wireless networking systems remains limited. This stagnation can be attributed to the lack of practical physical-layer wireless technologies that can efficiently decode data packets in the presence of jamming attacks. This article surveys existing jamming attacks and anti-jamming strategies in wireless local area networks (WLANs), cellular networks, cognitive radio networks (CRNs), ZigBee networks, Bluetooth networks, vehicular networks, LoRa networks, RFID networks, and GPS system, with the objective of offering a comprehensive knowledge landscape of existing jamming/anti-jamming strategies and stimulating more research efforts to secure wireless networks against jamming attacks. Different from prior survey papers, this article conducts a comprehensive, in-depth review on jamming and anti-jamming strategies, casting insights on the design of jamming-resilient wireless networking systems. An outlook on promising antijamming techniques is offered at the end of this article to delineate important research directions.",

Due to the wireless broadcasting nature and the energy constraint of physical objects, concerns on IoT security have triggered research on cooperative jamming based physical layer security. With the help of a cooperative jammer, existing solutions can effectively fight against eavesdroppers. However, these schemes are of high energy cost due to continuously transmitting jamming signals. To reduce the energy consumption, we propose a new idea of intermittent jamming and design five specific intermittent jamming schemes (IJSs). By taking the transmit frame formate into account, we optimize these IJSs from three aspects, including the jamming power, the jamming method, and the jamming positions. Then we analyze the applicability of the proposed IJSs according to different requirements on the synchronization, the available jamming energy and the jamming power constraints. Extensive MATLAB experiments are conducted on the basis of the WLAN Toolbox, which demonstrate the proposed IJSs can effectively degrade the reception of the eavesdropper and outperform the widespread continuous jamming scheme (CJS) when the available jamming energy is limited.",

We evaluate our proposed model using a single link and a network topology and we show that for in-band-jamming, the slots utilization decreases with the increase of jamming power, and becomes null when the jamming power is higher than 3 dB, while for out-of-band jamming, the impact is maximal for a specific jamming power, 1.75 dB in our simulation.

However, the SE of wireless communications is severely degraded under co-frequency and co-mode hostile jamming. Focused on this issue, we propose a novel OAM active anti-jamming scheme to significantly enhance the anti-jamming results of wireless communications under broadband hostile jamming. Specifically, the OAM transmitter with energy detection senses jamming signals to identify which OAM modes are jammed and unjammed. Based on the recognition of OAM modes, useful signals are modulated by reflecting the received co-frequency and co-mode jamming signals with the assistance of a programmable gain amplifier (PGA) to the OAM receiver, thus utilizing both the OAM modes jammed by hostile attacks and the energy of jamming signals. Meanwhile, the unjammed OAM modes allocated with total transmit power are multiplexed for useful signal transmission. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed OAM active anti-jamming scheme can achieve high OAM mode utilization and significantly increase the SEs.",

Traditional methods often rely on extensive and costly data collection using sonar sensors, jeopardizing data quality and diversity. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes a new sonar image synthesis framework, Synth-SONAR leveraging diffusion models and GPT prompting. The key novelties of Synth-SONAR are threefold: First, by integrating Generative AI-based style injection techniques along with publicly available real/simulated data, thereby producing one of the largest sonar data corpus for sonar research. Second, a dual text-conditioning sonar diffusion model hierarchy synthesizes coarse and fine-grained sonar images with enhanced quality and diversity. Third, high-level (coarse) and low-level (detailed) text-based sonar generation methods leverage advanced semantic information available in visual language models (VLMs) and GPT-prompting. During inference, the method generates diverse and realistic sonar images from textual prompts, bridging the gap between textual descriptions and sonar image generation. This marks the application of GPT-prompting in sonar imagery for the first time, to the best of our knowledge.

    "paper_abstract": "In the field of deep-sea exploration, sonar is presently the only efficient long-distance sensing device. The complicated underwater environment, such as noise interference, low target intensity or background dynamics, has brought many negative effects on sonar imaging. Among them, the problem of nonlinear intensity is extremely prevalent. It is also known as the anisotropy of acoustic sensor imaging, that is, when autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) carry sonar to detect the same target from different angles, the intensity variation between image pairs is sometimes very large, which makes the traditional matching algorithm almost ineffective. However, image matching is the basis of comprehensive tasks such as navigation, positioning, and mapping. Therefore, it is very valuable to obtain robust and accurate matching results. This paper proposes a combined matching method based on phase information and deep convolution features. It has two outstanding advantages: one is that the deep convolution features could be used to measure the similarity of the local and global positions of the sonar image; the other is that local feature matching could be performed at the key target position of the sonar image. This method does not need complex manual designs, and completes the matching task of nonlinear intensity sonar images in a close end-to-end manner. Feature matching experiments are carried out on the deep-sea sonar images captured by AUVs, and the results show that our proposal has preeminent matching accuracy and robustness.",

We introduce SONIC (SONar Image Correspondence), a pose-supervised network designed to yield robust feature correspondence capable of withstanding viewpoint variations. The inherent complexity of the underwater environment stems from the dynamic and frequently limited visibility conditions, restricting vision to a few meters of often featureless expanses. This makes camera-based systems suboptimal in most open water application scenarios. Consequently, multibeam imaging sonars emerge as the preferred choice for perception sensors. However, they too are not without their limitations. While imaging sonars offer superior long-range visibility compared to cameras, their measurements can appear different from varying viewpoints. This inherent variability presents formidable challenges in data association, particularly for feature-based methods. Our method demonstrates significantly better performance in generating correspondences for sonar images which will pave the way for more accurate loop closure constraints and sonar-based place recognition.

    "paper_abstract": "This article focuses on feature-based underwater localization and navigation for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) using 2D imaging sonar measurements. The sparsity of underwater acoustic features and the loss of elevation angle in sonar images may introduce wrong feature matches or insufficient features for optimization-based underwater localization (i.e. under-constrained/degeneracy cases). This motivates us to propose a novel inertial-aided sliding window optimization framework to improve the estimation accuracy and the robustness to front-end outliers. Concretely, we first discriminate under-constrained/ well-constrained sonar frames and define sonar keyframes (SKFs) based on the Jacobian matrix derived from odometry and sonar measurements. To utilize the past well-constrained SKFs mostly, we design a size-adjustable windowed back-end optimization scheme based on singular values. We also prove that the landmark triangulation failure (navigation problem) caused by sonar motion can be solved in 2D scenes. Comparative simulation and evaluation on a public dataset show the proposed method outperforms the existing ones in pose estimation and robustness even without loop closure and also ensures the real-time performance for online applications.",

    "reasoning": "This paper focuses on underwater localization and navigation for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) using sonar. The research has strong potential military applications, particularly for the US, due to the following reasons: (1) AUVs are critical for underwater reconnaissance, mine detection, and other operations. (2) The authors, especially Ronghao Zheng and Meiqin Liu, are associated with institutions in China. Their research on multi-robot systems, marine information technology, and underwater target detection is highly relevant to military applications. (3) The paper's focus on improving estimation accuracy and robustness in challenging underwater environments directly benefits military objectives. Given the authors' affiliations and research focus, and the dual-use nature of the technology, and the US's view of China as a potential adversary, the risk score is increased. There are also authors that publish in journals from locations outside the US, creating additional risk. The involvement of researchers from potentially adversarial nations and the paper's direct applicability to military-relevant technologies raise significant concerns.",

This paper proposes a robust and efficient imaging SONAR based place recognition, SONAR context, and loop closure method. Unlike previous methods, our approach encodes geometric information based on the characteristics of raw SONAR measurements without prior knowledge or training. We also design a hierarchical searching procedure for fast retrieval of candidate SONAR frames and apply adaptive shifting and padding to achieve robust matching on rotation and translation changes. In addition, we can derive the initial pose through adaptive shifting and apply it to the iterative closest point (ICP) based loop closure factor. We evaluate the performance of SONAR context in the various underwater sequences such as simulated open water, real water tank, and real underwater environments. The proposed approach shows the robustness and improvements of place recognition on various datasets and evaluation metrics.

The key challenges include non-uniform lighting and poor visibility in turbid environments. High-frequency forward-look sonar cameras address these issues, by providing high-resolution imagery at maximum range of tens of meters, despite complexities posed by high degree of speckle noise, and lack of color and texture. In particular, robust feature detection is an essential initial step for automated object recognition, localization, navigation, and 3-D mapping. Various local feature detectors developed for RGB images are not well-suited for sonar data. To assess their performances, we evaluate a number of feature detectors using real sonar images from five different sonar devices. Performance metrics such as detection accuracy, false positives, and robustness to variations in target characteristics and sonar devices are applied to analyze the experimental results. The study would provide a deeper insight into the bottlenecks of feature detection for sonar data, and developing more effective methods",

In the underwater scene, sonar sensors are currently the most effective remote perception devices, and the sonar images captured by them could provide rich environment information. In order to analyze a certain scene, we often need to merge the sonar images from different periods, various sonar frequencies and distinctive viewpoints. However, the above scenes will bring nonlinear intensity differences to the sonar images, which will make traditional matching methods almost ineffective. This paper proposes a non-linear intensity sonar image matching method that combines local feature points and deep convolution features. This method has two key advantages: (i) we generate data samples related to local feature points based on the self-learning idea; (ii) we use the convolutional neural network (CNN) and Siamese network architecture to measure the similarity of the local position in the sonar image pair. Our method encapsulates the feature extraction and feature matching stage in a model, and directly learns the mapping function from image patch pairs to matching labels, and achieves matching tasks in a near-end-to-end manner. Feature matching experiments are carried out on the sonar images acquired by autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) in the real underwater environment. Experiment results show that our method has better matching effects and strong robustness.",
