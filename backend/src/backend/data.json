    "paper_abstract": "The increasing reliance on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), particularly the Global Positioning System (GPS), underscores the urgent need to safeguard these technologies against malicious threats such as spoofing and jamming. As the backbone for positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) across various applications including transportation, telecommunications, and emergency services- GNSS is vulnerable to deliberate interference that poses significant risks. Spoofing attacks, which involve transmitting counterfeit GNSS signals to mislead receivers into calculating incorrect positions, can result in serious consequences, from navigational errors in civilian aviation to security breaches in military operations. Furthermore, the lack of inherent security measures within GNSS systems makes them attractive targets for adversaries. While GNSS/GPS jamming and spoofing systems consist of numerous components, the ability to distinguish authentic signals from malicious ones is essential for maintaining system integrity. Recent advancements in machine learning and deep learning provide promising avenues for enhancing detection and mitigation strategies against these threats. This paper addresses both spoofing and jamming by tackling real-world challenges through machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision techniques. Through extensive experiments on two real-world datasets related to spoofing and jamming detection using advanced algorithms, we achieved state-of-the-art results. In the GNSS/GPS jamming detection task, we attained approximately 99% accuracy, improving performance by around 5% compared to previous studies. Additionally, we addressed a challenging tasks related to spoofing detection, yielding results that underscore the potential of machine learning and deep learning in this domain.",

Electromagnetic space is an important dimension of modern warfare. Modeling and analyzing the CSoS from this perspective is of great significance to studying modern warfare and can provide a reference for the research of electromagnetic warfare. In this study, the types of nodes and relationships in the complex electromagnetic space of CSoS are first divided, the important attributes of the combat nodes are extracted, and the relationship weights are normalized to establish a networked model. On this basis, the calculation method of CSoS combat effectiveness based on the combat cycle is proposed, and then the identification and sorting of key nodes can be realized by the node deletion method.

Destabilizing AI developments could rupture the balance of power and raise the odds of great-power conflict, while widespread proliferation of capable AI hackers and virologists would lower barriers for rogue actors to cause catastrophe. Superintelligence—AI vastly better than humans at nearly all cognitive tasks—is now anticipated by AI researchers. Just as nations once developed nuclear strategies to secure their survival, we now need a coherent superintelligence strategy to navigate a new period of transformative change. We introduce the concept of Mutual Assured AI Malfunction (MAIM): a deterrence regime resembling nuclear mutual assured destruction (MAD) where any state's aggressive bid for unilateral AI dominance is met with preventive sabotage by rivals. Given the relative ease of sabotaging a destabilizing AI project through interventions ranging from covert cyberattacks to potential kinetic strikes on datacenters—MAIM already describes the strategic picture AI superpowers find themselves in. Alongside this, states can increase their competitiveness by bolstering their economies and militaries through AI, and they can engage in nonproliferation to rogue actors to keep weaponizable AI capabilities out of their hands. Taken together, the three-part framework of deterrence, nonproliferation, and competitiveness outlines a robust strategy to superintelligence in the years ahead.",

    "paper_abstract": "Wireless signal recognition (WSR) is a crucial technique for intelligent communications and spectrum sharing in the next six-generation (6G) wireless communication networks. It can be utilized to enhance network performance and efficiency, improve quality of service (QoS), and improve network security and reliability. Additionally, WSR can be applied for military applications such as signal interception, signal race, and signal abduction. In the past decades, great efforts have been made for the research of WSR. Earlier works mainly focus on model-based methods, including likelihood-based (LB) and feature-based (FB) methods, which have taken the leading position for many years. With the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI), intelligent methods including machine learning-based (ML-based) and deep learning-based (DL-based) methods have been developed to extract the features of the received signals and perform the classification. In this work, we provide a comprehensive review of WSR from the view of applications, main tasks, recent advances, datasets and evaluation metrics, challenges, and future directions. Specifically, intelligent WSR methods are introduced from the perspective of model, data, learning and implementation. Moreover, we analyze the challenges for WSR from the view of complex, dynamic, and open 6G wireless environments and discuss the future directions for WSR. This survey is expected to provide a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art WSR techniques and inspire new research directions for WSR in 6G networks.",

The traditional post-training analysis relies on manually reviewing 2-dimensional (2D) videos, a time-consuming process that lacks comprehensive situational awareness. To address these limitations, we introduce ACT360, a system that leverages 360-degree videos and machine learning for automated action detection and structured debriefing. ACT360 integrates 360YOWO, an enhanced You Only Watch Once (YOWO) model with spatial attention and equirectangular-aware convolution (EAC) to mitigate panoramic video distortions. To enable deployment in resource-constrained environments, we apply quantization and model pruning, reducing the model size by 74% while maintaining robust accuracy (mAP drop of only 1.5%, from 0.865 to 0.850) and improving inference speed. We validate our approach on a publicly available dataset of 55 labeled 360-degree videos covering seven key operational actions, recorded across various real-world training sessions and environmental conditions. Additionally, ACT360 integrates 360AIE (Action Insight Explorer), a web-based interface for automatic action detection, retrieval, and textual summarization using large language models (LLMs), significantly enhancing post-incident analysis efficiency. ACT360 serves as a generalized framework for mission-critical debriefing, incorporating EAC, spatial attention, summarization, and model optimization.

Multi-agent cooperative decision-making involves multiple agents working together to complete established tasks and achieve specific objectives. These techniques are widely applicable in real-world scenarios such as autonomous driving, drone navigation, disaster rescue, and simulated military confrontations. This paper begins with a comprehensive survey of the leading simulation environments and platforms used for multi-agent cooperative decision-making. Specifically, we provide an in-depth analysis for these simulation environments from various perspectives, including task formats, reward allocation, and the underlying technologies employed. Subsequently, we provide a comprehensive overview of the mainstream intelligent decision-making approaches, algorithms and models for multi-agent systems (MAS). These approaches can be broadly categorized into five types: rule-based (primarily fuzzy logic), game theory-based, evolutionary algorithms-based, deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)-based, and large language models (LLMs) reasoning-based. Given the significant advantages of MARL and LLMs-based decision-making methods over the traditional rule, game theory, and evolutionary algorithms, this paper focuses on these multi-agent methods utilizing MARL and LLMs-based techniques. We provide an in-depth discussion of these approaches, highlighting their methodology taxonomies, advantages, and drawbacks.

Existing research predominantly focuses on designing efficient and high-success-rate hunting policy, particularly addressing the target's evasion capabilities. However, in real-world scenarios, the target can not only adjust its evasion policy based on its observations and predictions but also possess eavesdropping capabilities. If communication among hunter AUVs, such as hunting policy exchanges, is intercepted by the target, it can adapt its escape policy accordingly, significantly reducing the success rate of the hunting mission. To address this challenge, we propose a covert communication-guaranteed collaborative target hunting framework, which ensures efficient hunting in complex underwater environments while defending against the target's eavesdropping. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to incorporate the confidentiality of inter-agent communication into the design of target hunting policy. Furthermore, given the complexity of coordinating multiple AUVs in dynamic and unpredictable environments, we propose an adaptive multi-agent diffusion policy (AMADP), which incorporates the strong generative ability of diffusion models into the multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that AMADP achieves faster convergence and higher hunting success rates while maintaining covertness constraints.",

Traditional sarcasm detection tasks have typically focused on single-modal approaches (e.g., text), but due to the implicit and subtle nature of sarcasm, such methods often fail to yield satisfactory results. In recent years, researchers have shifted the focus of sarcasm detection to multi-modal approaches. However, effectively leveraging multi-modal information to accurately identify sarcastic content remains a challenge that warrants further exploration. Leveraging the powerful integrated processing capabilities of Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for various information sources, we propose an innovative multi-modal Commander-GPT framework. Inspired by military strategy, we first decompose the sarcasm detection task into six distinct sub-tasks. A central commander (decision-maker) then assigns the best-suited large language model to address each specific sub-task. Ultimately, the detection results from each model are aggregated to identify sarcasm. We conducted extensive experiments on MMSD and MMSD 2.0, utilizing four multi-modal large language models and six prompting strategies. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 19.3% improvement in F1 score, without necessitating fine-tuning or ground-truth rationales.",

However, the underlying technologies, particularly multimodal large language models (MLLMs), are of strategic interest. The focus on sarcasm detection, while potentially useful for social media monitoring or deception analysis, is unlikely to have strong direct military applications. Furthermore, the development country, China, increases the risk profile due to potential for dual-use technologies and foreign military applications. Given the researchers are primarily based in China, there is a risk the technology could be leveraged for military purposes.

We first formulate the diffusive relaxation system based on the even-odd decomposition method, which allows us to split into one relaxation step and one transport step. We adopt a robust implicit scheme that can be explicitly implemented for the relaxation step that involves the stiffness of the collision term, while the third-order strong-stability-preserving Runge-Kutta method is employed for the transport step. We couple this temporal scheme with the DG method for spatial discretization, which provides additional advantages including high-order accuracy, h-p adaptivity, and the ability to handle arbitrary unstructured meshes. A positivity-preserving limiter is further applied to preserve physical properties of numerical solutions. The stability analysis using the even-odd decomposition is conducted for the first time. We demonstrate the accuracy and performance of our proposed scheme through several numerical examples.",

Frameworks such as Unity's ML-Agents help to make such reinforcement learning experiments more accessible to the simulation community. Military training simulations also benefit from advances in MARL, but they have immense computational requirements due to their complex, continuous, stochastic, partially observable, non-stationary, and doctrine-based nature. Furthermore, these simulations require geo-specific terrains, further exacerbating the computational resources problem. In our research, we leverage Unity's waypoints to automatically generate multi-layered representation abstractions of the geo-specific terrains to scale up reinforcement learning while still allowing the transfer of learned policies between different representations. Our early exploratory results on a novel MARL scenario, where each side has differing objectives, indicate that waypoint-based navigation enables faster and more efficient learning while producing trajectories similar to those taken by expert human players in CSGO gaming environments. This research points out the potential of waypoint-based navigation for reducing the computational costs of developing and training MARL models for military training simulations, where geo-specific terrains and differing objectives are crucial.",

It presents a comparative analysis and evaluation of various forecasting methods for predicting the aging of these devices in online health monitoring systems. The core of the paper lies in the application of machine learning and statistical techniques to forecast the remaining useful life (RUL) of MOSFETs, with a focus on addressing the challenge of predicting long-term aging. The study benchmarks classical methods like ARIMA and Holt models against novel approaches, including Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFTs). The key components involve the creation of a framework that identifies key aging turning points and the use of covariates. Novelty lies in using transformer architectures for MOSFET prognostics and the comparative assessment framework, along with a comparative evaluation of different architectures for different forecasting horizons.",

    "paper_abstract": "Semiconductor devices, especially MOSFETs (Metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor), are crucial in power electronics, but their reliability is affected by aging processes influenced by cycling and temperature. The primary aging mechanism in discrete semiconductors and power modules is the bond wire lift-off, caused by crack growth due to thermal fatigue. The process is empirically characterized by exponential growth and an abrupt end of life, making long-term aging forecasts challenging. This research presents a comprehensive comparative assessment of different forecasting methods for MOSFET failure forecasting applications. Classical tracking, statistical forecasting and Neural Network (NN) based forecasting models are implemented along with novel Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFTs). A comprehensive comparison is performed assessing their MOSFET ageing forecasting ability for different forecasting horizons. For short-term predictions, all algorithms result in acceptable results, with the best results produced by classical NN forecasting models, at the expense of higher computations. For long-term forecasting, only the TFT is able to produce valid outcomes owing to the ability to integrate covariates from the expected future conditions. Additionally, TFT attention points identify key ageing turning points, which indicate new failure modes or accelerated ageing phases.",

    "reasoning": "The research paper focuses on predicting the aging and remaining useful life (RUL) of MOSFETs (Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistors) using machine learning and statistical techniques. MOSFETs are fundamental components in power electronics, and the paper's findings could be applied to various military applications where the reliability of electronic systems is critical. Specifically, the ability to forecast the lifespan of these components can be valuable in autonomous systems, and predictive maintenance, where long-term forecasting is essential. The paper is published by a Spanish university, which may limit direct access and control from the US perspective. Furthermore, the research involves collaboration with institutions in the UK and Denmark, increasing the risk from foreign collaboration. While the technology itself doesn't appear to have inherently dangerous applications, the focus on semiconductor reliability, potentially applicable to military hardware, raises a moderate level of concern. The paper's potential for military applications is tied to its relevance in energy systems, and predictive maintenance, but the foreign origin and international collaboration create a moderate risk profile.",

We implemented and tested our algorithm on both molecular and solid-state systems, confirming the predicted scaling behavior by systematically increasing the number of atoms, the size of the basis set, and the density of k-point sampling. Using the benzene molecular crystal as a case study, we demonstrated that SOS-RILT-MP2 achieves significantly improved efficiency compared to conventional MP2.

It has been selected as the target of the Hayabusa2 extended mission, which will rendezvous with 1998 KY26 in 2031. However, one of the most basic physical properties, size, remains poorly constrained, posing potential challenges for spacecraft operations. We aimed at constraining the size of 1998 KY26 by means of thermal infrared observations. We performed thermal infrared observations of 1998 KY26 using the ESO Very Large Telescope/VISIR on three consecutive nights in May 2024. After stacking all frames, we find no apparent detection of 1998 KY26 on the resulting images. The upper-limit flux density of 1998 KY26 is derived as 2 mJy at 10.64 μm. From this upper-limit flux density obtained via non-detection, we conclude that the diameter of 1998 KY26 is smaller than 17 m with thermophysical modeling. This upper limit size is smaller than the radar-derived 30 (±10) m. Our size constraint on 1998 KY26 is essential for the operation of the Hayabusa2 spacecraft during proximity operations using remote sensing instruments as well as a possible impact experiment using the remaining projectile.",

Integrated circuits (ICs) are the backbone of today's computing devices across industries, including artificial intelligence (AI), consumer electronics, healthcare, automotive, industrial, and aerospace. Moore's Law has driven the semiconductor IC industry toward smaller dimensions, improved performance, and greater energy efficiency. However, as transistors shrink to atomic scales, aging-related degradation mechanisms such as Bias Temperature Instability (BTI), Hot Carrier Injection (HCI), Time-Dependent Dielectric Breakdown (TDDB), Electromigration (EM), and stochastic aging-induced variations have become major reliability threats. From an application perspective, applications like AI training and autonomous driving require continuous and sustainable operation to minimize recovery costs and enhance safety. Additionally, the high cost of chip replacement and reproduction underscores the need for extended lifespans. These factors highlight the urgency of designing more reliable ICs as key computing infrastructure. This survey addresses the critical issue of aging in ICs, focusing on fundamental degradation mechanisms and mitigation strategies. It provides a comprehensive overview of aging's impact and the methods to counter it, starting with the root causes of aging and summarizing key monitoring techniques at both circuit and system levels.

    "paper_abstract": "The inability of autonomous vehicles (AVs) to infer the material properties of obstacles limits their decision-making capacity. While AVs rely on sensor systems such as cameras, LiDAR, and radar to detect obstacles, this study suggests combining sensors with a knowledge graph (KG)-based world model to improve AVs' comprehension of physical material qualities. Beyond sensor data, AVs can infer qualities such as malleability, density, and elasticity using a semantic KG that depicts the relationships between obstacles and their attributes. Using the CARLA autonomous driving simulator, we evaluated AV performance with and without KG integration. The findings demonstrate that the KG-based method improves obstacle management, which allows AVs to use material qualities to make better decisions about when to change lanes or apply emergency braking. For example, the KG-integrated AV changed lanes for hard impediments like traffic cones and successfully avoided collisions with flexible items such as plastic bags by passing over them. Compared to the control system, the KG framework demonstrated improved responsiveness to obstacles by resolving conflicting sensor data, causing emergency stops for 13.3% more cases. In addition, our method exhibits a 6.6% higher success rate in lane-changing maneuvers in experimental scenarios, particularly for larger, high-impact obstacles. While we focus particularly on autonomous driving, our work demonstrates the potential of KG-based world models to improve decision-making in embodied AI systems and scale to other domains, including robotics, healthcare, and environmental simulation.",

    "reasoning": "This research paper, originating from the USA, focuses on integrating knowledge graphs with autonomous vehicles to improve their decision-making capabilities. The core technology involves understanding material properties of objects to enhance obstacle handling.  From a US military perspective, this has several applications. Firstly, it directly impacts autonomous vehicle development, which is crucial for unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) and potentially unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Improved obstacle handling could lead to more robust and reliable military vehicles. Secondly, the use of knowledge graphs suggests the potential to integrate this with other sensors and data sources, improving situational awareness, a key element in military operations.  Thirdly, the research mentions applicability to robotics, which has clear military applications in areas such as reconnaissance, logistics, and combat operations.  However, since this research is from the US and will likely be published, it will likely be open to the public and not considered high risk.

In conventional MIMO systems, depolarization arises solely from the channel; however, in XL-MIMO systems, non-stationary properties of the array cause additional polarization shifts at each antenna element, further degrading JRC performance. This paper introduces a channel model incorporating polarization shifts due to the propagation channel and antenna elements in the near-field. We also propose an antenna selection (AS) scheme that dynamically chooses antennas based on polarization imbalance and cross-pol leakage, enhancing spectral efficiency, symbol error rate, and radar detection probability.

Specifically, this paper explores the consequences of assuming that the family of spatial receptive fields should be covariant under spatial affine transformations, thereby implying that the receptive fields ought to span a variability over the degree of elongation. We investigate the theoretical properties of three main ways of defining idealized models of complex cells and compare the predictions from these models to neurophysiologically obtained receptive field histograms over the resultant of biological orientation selectivity curves. It is shown that the extended modelling mechanisms lead to more uniform behaviour and a wider span over the values of the resultants that are covered, compared to earlier presented idealized models of complex cells without spatial integration. More generally, we propose that the presented methodology could be used as a new tool to evaluate other computational models of complex cells in relation to biological measurements.",

Since the research was completed and delivered, new organizations have been created and important steps have been taken to address many of the topics the report describes. As a result, this report does not capture the current state of the topic at the time of publication. Although expert and public opinions may have shifted, we believe the report documents a useful view of perspectives. Furthermore, several chapters present historical perspectives of American, Chinese, and Russian willingness or reticence to develop and/or field artificial intelligence (AI) for the battlefield. This report examines military applications of AI and considers the ethical implications of employing them in war and peace. Al encompasses a wide range of technologies, many of which offer great promise in military applications. Consequently, the United States, China, and Russia are all developing military applications of AI. Given the rapid progress seen in this field during the last two decades, this could change the character of war in the coming years. But thoughtful people have expressed serious reservations about the legal and ethical implications of military forces using AI. The most strident objections have revolved around prospects of machines killing people, without direct approval of human operators. But concerns have been raised about other applications of AI as well, such as decision support systems that might select questionable targets without commanders being able to examine the complex calculations behind such choices, and citizens being detained or even killed as a result of a facial recognition system or some other complex AI calculation misidentifying them as terrorists or criminals. These concerns raise serious questions about the ethical implications of military applications of AI and the extent to which U.S. leaders should regulate their development or restrain their employment. But equally serious questions revolve around whether potential U.S. adversaries would be willing to impose comparable guidelines and restraints and, if not, whether the United States' self-restraint might put it at a disadvantage in future conflicts. With these concerns in mind, this report seeks to answer the following questions for the U.S. Air Force (USAF): (1) What significant military applications of AI are currently available or expected to emerge in next 10–15 years? (2) What legal, moral, or ethical issues would developing or employing such systems raise? (3) What significant military applications of AI are China and Russia currently pursuing? (4) Does China, Russia, or the United States have exploitable vulnerabilities due to ethical or cultural limits on the development or employment of military applications of AI? (5) How can USAF maximize the benefits potentially available from military applications of AI, while mitigating the risks they entail?",

    "reasoning": "This paper directly addresses military applications of AI, a field with significant implications for defense and warfare. It examines AI's use in decision-making, intelligence gathering, and autonomous systems, all critical areas for military advantage. The paper also analyzes the development of military AI in the US, China, and Russia, highlighting the strategic importance of this technology and the potential for geopolitical competition. The topics covered include AI, Defense Technology, Autonomous Systems, Cybersecurity, Geopolitical Tech Strategy, and Innovation Policy, indicating a high relevance to military applications. Given the focus on US, Chinese, and Russian military AI development, the content is highly relevant to US national security interests, including the potential for adversarial AI systems. The study also highlights the ethical considerations and risks associated with military AI, underscoring its significance for defense policy and strategy. The mention of potentially 'questionable targets' and 'misidentifying' citizens via AI, and the question of if the US should restrain its AI development versus its adversaries clearly implies high military applications.",

    "paper_abstract": "Frontier models have either been language-only or have primarily focused on vision and language modalities. Although recent advancements in models with vision and audio understanding capabilities have shown substantial progress, the field lacks a standardized evaluation framework for thoroughly assessing their cross-modality perception performance. We introduce MAVERIX (Multimodal Audio-Visual Evaluation Reasoning IndeX), a novel benchmark with 700 videos and 2,556 questions explicitly designed to evaluate multimodal models through tasks that necessitate close integration of video and audio information. MAVERIX uniquely provides models with audiovisual tasks, closely mimicking the multimodal perceptual experiences available to humans during inference and decision-making processes. To our knowledge, MAVERIX is the first benchmark aimed explicitly at assessing comprehensive audiovisual integration. Experiments with state-of-the-art models, including Gemini 1.5 Pro and o1, show performance approaching human levels (around 70% accuracy), while human experts reach near-ceiling performance (95.1%). With standardized evaluation protocols, a rigorously annotated pipeline, and a public toolkit (maverix-benchmark.github.io), MAVERIX establishes a challenging testbed for advancing audio-visual multimodal intelligence.",

    "reasoning": "The paper introduces MAVERIX, a benchmark for evaluating AI systems' multimodal video-audio understanding. The core technology involves advanced AI, particularly in the domain of multimodal understanding, which is highly relevant to autonomous systems and robotics. The ability to integrate video and audio data could be directly applied in military contexts. Specific applications include improved situational awareness through enhanced sensor fusion (e.g., integrating drone video with audio from battlefield), autonomous navigation of robots and vehicles in complex environments, and enhanced surveillance capabilities. Given the focus on the US-based authors, US military application is highly probable. The technology could also be used for training AI models for specific military scenarios and threat detection, enhancing existing military systems, and developing new ones. Given the focus on the US, and the fact that it is at CMU, a US university, and the technology is not inherently dual-use, I have given it a low risk score.",

    "paper_summary": "This paper introduces a generative modeling technique for solving blind inverse problems in imaging, where the imaging system's characteristics are unknown. The method uses unpaired clean images and corrupted measurements to learn a prior distribution over the imaging system's parameters. This learned distribution can then be used in model-based recovery algorithms, such as blind deconvolution. The technique is demonstrated on blind deconvolution problems, including Gaussian and motion blur, showing its effectiveness in reconstructing images from noisy measurements. The approach provides a versatile tool for enabling blind inverse imaging problem solvers and addresses limitations of previous models.",

    "paper_abstract": "Blind inverse problems in imaging arise from uncertainties in the system used to collect noisy measurements of images. Recovering clean images from these measurements typically requires identifying the imaging system, either implicitly or explicitly. A common solution leverages generative models as priors for both the images and the imaging system parameters (e.g., a class of point spread functions). To learn these priors in a straightforward manner requires access to a dataset of clean images as well as samples of the imaging system. We propose an AmbientGAN-based generative technique to identify the distribution of parameters in unknown imaging systems, using only unpaired clean images and corrupted measurements. This learned distribution can then be used in model-based recovery algorithms to solve blind inverse problems such as blind deconvolution. We successfully demonstrate our technique for learning Gaussian blur and motion blur priors from noisy measurements and show their utility in solving blind deconvolution with diffusion posterior sampling.",

    "reasoning": "The research paper's focus on blind inverse problems in imaging, particularly its application to deconvolution, has strong potential military applications. The ability to reconstruct images from noisy or corrupted measurements is crucial for various military operations. Specifically, the technology could enhance surveillance capabilities by improving image clarity from potentially obscured or degraded sources. It could also be applied to enhance the performance of sensor systems, such as those used in targeting, reconnaissance, and autonomous systems. The involvement of researchers from US institutions and the focus on improving image reconstruction techniques further amplify the potential for military utilization. Because it could enhance the ability to see, this would be a huge advantage to the US military.",
