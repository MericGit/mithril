I can really feel the AGI

npm run start
npm run build
npm run test

poetry run python -m uvicorn backend.main:app --reload


Can you make it so that the frontend can upload a pdf to the backend? We can implement logic of how to handle the file but I want to be able to upload the PDF to backend. Also, upon uploading and processing, the backend will return a paper and I would like you to show it on Papers.tsx (may need to move the user to that page upon receiving it)
